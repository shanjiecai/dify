hello

Hey there! How can I help you today?
Can you describe the timing and coordination required between the kick and the arm movements in breaststroke?





In breaststroke, the timing and coordination between the kick and arm movements are crucial for efficiency and speed. Typically, as your arms pull in towards your chest, your legs begin the kicking motion.

Have you practiced the glide phase in breaststroke, and do you understand its importance?




Yes, the glide phase in breaststroke is essential for efficiency and speed.

Do you know how to perform the breathing technique properly in breaststroke?




Certainly! In breaststroke, the breathing technique involves lifting your head out of the water to take a breath during the recovery phase of the stroke.

Is there anything else you would like to know about breaststroke technique?




As your arms are extended forward after the glide phase, tilt your head slightly forward, keeping your eyes looking down towards the water. Then, as your arms begin to pull back, lift your head and chin just above the surface of the water, allowing yourself to take a quick breath. It's important to keep your head relatively low to minimize resistance and maintain momentum. After breathing, quickly tuck your chin back down as your arms complete the pull and extend forward again for the glide phase. Practice timing your breaths with your stroke rhythm to maintain a smooth and efficient swimming technique.

I don't know.

Can you describe the timing and coordination required between the kick and the arm movements in breaststroke?




I can swim continuously for half an hour, up to 800 meters

Have you received any formal coaching or instruction on improving your breaststroke technique?




there has never been

Are you aware of common mistakes made in breaststroke and how to correct them?




Yes, I'm aware of common mistakes made in breaststroke and how to correct them. Some common mistakes include:

Incorrect timing between the arm pull and kick: This can lead to inefficiency and loss of propulsion. To correct it, focus on coordinating your arm pull and kick so they occur simultaneously, with the kick starting as the arms begin to pull back.

Dropping the head too low during the breath: This can increase drag and disrupt your body position. To correct it, practice lifting your head just enough to take a breath without dropping it too low, and maintain a streamlined position.
