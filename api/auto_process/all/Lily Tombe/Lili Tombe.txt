Question:
Okay. So can you tell me your name?

Lili Tombe:
yes。 My name is Lily Tombay. I'm 18 years old. I'm from San Diego, but I am attending university of California Irvine this fall, and I'll be an incoming freshman.

Question:
Cool. What's your major?

Lili Tombe:
I'm a political science major.

Question:
Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why you chose that major and the career path you kind of see yourself going towards.

Lili Tombe:
I would say for the longest time I thought I wanted to be, like a history teacher. So I've kind of always been interested in history and politics and stuff like that. I think especially after 2020, I became super interested in politics and the things going on in the world. My end goal is actually to be a civil rights lawyer. I don't plan on staying in politics for too long, but. Thought poly side was a good base for me to kind of learn a little bit more about the government, and just.

Lili Tombe:
The things going on. So I see myself being a civil rights attorney down the line. But, so weirdly enough, for the longest time, my mom always said that she thought I was gonna be a lawyer.

Question:
That's awesome. Did anything spark you wanting to be an attorney, or is that just something that you wanna do?

Lili Tombe:
And because I didn't want to do what my mom said I was gonna do, I was like, no, I'm not. And then it weirdly, like growing up, I was interested in law. I did like mock trial in high school and was always just interested in that area. So I decided maybe I am interested in line. I got to be in the courtroom during mock trial and work with real attorneys and judges. And that was really like an eye opening experience. So that really solidified my, the career path that I wanna go down.

Question:
It's awesome how do you explain to me, like I'm trying to ask this in the right way. Do you see yourself, why do you see yourself being Lars? They because you're very like passion about things or I'm trying to say like, why do you wanna be like a lawyer? Kind of.

Lili Tombe:
I would say I'm very, I am very passionate about things like, and. Also, I'm really interested in writing and stuff like that. And I know with that career path, I will have to do a lot of writing and reading and stuff like that. But I've always been somebody who. Is likes to stand up for people and stands up for what's right. And so being able to do that in a professional sense, I thought that was really cool.

Question:
What are your top three passions in life? Not just being a lawyer, but.

Lili Tombe:
Always. Oh, that's really. That's a good one. Okay. I would say writing. I'm pretty passionate about that, like all things running. I write poetry. I journal and all that stuff. And then singing is something that I've been doing since I was really little. So that's something that I'm also passionate about, like music and like how music helps people and like all that. Stuff. And then lastly, I would just say. I don't know. Like I'm a huge, like. That's a. What is my love? Well, also my question about I'm just really interested in helping people. And I know that's very cliche, but just like. And. Different ways, like giving back in some way. I did a lot of mentorship work when I was in high school with middle schoolers. Just giving back and to your community in some way, whatever that looks like.

Question:
Let's see. Do you know where you wanna go to law school?

Lili Tombe:
No clue. I'm thinking about probably just staying at UC Irvine, and if not, coming back to San Diego in 1 USD. Am I the cousin that is currently in law school? USD. So maybe that, but a little bit for law school or this interview.

Question:
Are you a nervous. Oh, law school.

Lili Tombe:
Okay. Definitely. I think because my plan is to with my major, a lot of people end up actually being able to graduate in three years rather than four. So law school could actually be a lot quicker than I think, or come up a lot sooner than I think it's going to. And because of that, I have to study for the Elsa a little bit early, by my sophomore year of college, actually. So I'm definitely nervous. Don't really know I'm gonna get in. The hope is I do. And a lot of people get, like, super burnt out and stuff like that. So I know like aposture Syndrom's probably gonna hit. If it doesn't hit an undergrad, it definitely will among school. So I think I'm super. Nervous to enter that space, and I'm also very competitive in a good way. So hopefully, that helps me get through those three years. But.

Question:
Have you? Researched or looked up any civil rights trials that kind of sparked your interest. Is there any that we're like, this is why I wanna do this?

Lili Tombe:
So I didn't necessarily, I wasn't looking at trials, but I was looking at situations that I didn't know were argued by civil rights attorneys. For example, in 2020, the George Floyd incident, I didn't realize that the attorney that represented him, one of the things that he worked with was civil rights law.

Lili Tombe:
I've more so looked at the things that I always wanted to do. Like at some point in time, I thought I wanted to be a social worker. I wanted to work with immigrants and women and children. And I realize that civil rights actually. Combines a lot of that, and I thought that was really interesting. I didn't really see myself being like a corporate lawyer or like a divorce attorney. I wanted to do something that I kind of had a connection with. But, so, but I would say that.

Question:
That's awesome what is a place to consider your happy place?

Lili Tombe:
I would say. Not necessarily a place, but like, an atmosphere that I can create. So if it's like my room and I like play some Common Music, or for example, like my church is something that I consider a happy place a lot. So I'll just say it just depends on the atmosphere that I create and the people that are in there, but I don't have a specific place. I would say my happy place.

Question:
Can you explain to me your favorite thing about your hobbies or you're just your hobbies in general?

Lili Tombe:
Yes. Well, my biggest hobby thing that I've been doing for a while is singing. And that started when I was really little. And pretty much my whole entire family, like, for the most part, except for the guys. Can sing.

Lili Tombe:
And it's been like a different way for me to express my creativity for the longest time. I think it's a great way to also distress. I started learning how to play instruments when I was, like, like 10. And so I also was able to kind of learn the technical aspects of music. And then not really help me as a vocalist, but I would say it's really cool way to express your creativity and reach people beyond just words.

Lili Tombe:
And then for writing the same thing, it was really just a distresser for me at the beginning. And then I realize I actually had, I was kind of good at it and I was able to combine my interests with my hobby. So I ended up writing for a couple news. Like publications that people that I know have started. And I was able to combine my writing skills with my interests in civil rights and politics and social justice and stuff like that. And I think that's pretty much it.

Question:
Awesome what's your favorite type of. Music.

Lili Tombe:
Oh, okay. I would say just like R&D or pop. I wasn't a country fan for the longest time, and then I randomly just started listening to country music. So it's definitely making its way to the top, but mainly just like pop and like R&B. I'm a huge sizzle fan, like everybody, pretty much, but huge.

Question:
In. What's your go to comfort food? When you're having a bad night, you're like, I need some comfort food. Like?

Lili Tombe:
Oh, okay. What happened? On a bad day, what really hits is like a California burrito. Don't know if it's like a comfort food because you can't make it in your house. We could, but I would just go get a California burrito and sit in my.

Question:
Good. So good. I'm trying to think, there's a really good spot for breakfast burrito. And I think it was, it's called Sancho or no, sorry, lubase.

Lili Tombe:
Oh, okay. I think I've been there.

Question:
And they have like this one, and it's like a whole burrito and it's like a case Rito, but there's takedos in it to cycle whole. I remember it was like this thing when I got it. I was. I ate half and save the rest. But it was so good.

Lili Tombe:
That's super gold. No, I'm honestly, I'm not that. I like breakfast burritos. It just has to be from a good place or they're not gonna hit. So, but good to know. Maybe all.

Question:
Are you a morning. Oh, what? Sorry.

Lili Tombe:
Go ahead.

Question:
I was just gonna share you a morning person.

Lili Tombe:
No, not really. I used to be when I had to wake up for at 6:30 for school. Now that I don't. Oh, I will sleep in as long as I can stop.

Question:
That's valid. Do you.

Question:
You have a routine, a night time routine?

Lili Tombe:
Ideal. I will after I'm done with whatever I need to do that day, I'll go, I'll shower and I'll come into my room and like, but. My email or whatever I have to do. And then I will whip out my journal and do my demotional time and just also my writing time and listen to music while I do, that. And then I've been trying not to use my phone right before I go to sleep, but sometimes I do go on TikTok really quick and then go to sleep and do it all over again. But.

Question:
What are your thoughts on today's generation and, like, being in your 20s and, like, how things have changed? So drastically from maybe 20 years ago, like just this generation and the stigma and all of that, like what is your thoughts on that?

Lili Tombe:
I think this generation has, as much as people like to hate on it, like a lot of good in it. Obviously with good, there's always gonna be some level of bad, but I think our generation has done a good job with what we've been given. And I always, I like heard this quote. I don't know who said it, but it's like for such a time as this, like we were all created for this moment in time. So I think, I think I have a lot of respect for our generation.

Lili Tombe:
And I think that the things that we're facing. That we are the ones who are meant to face it and overcome it. And it's something that previous generations weren't able to do, for example. With the strides that we've made with technology, I think that's like, obviously like incredible. And I. Think we're very unique with the struggles that we've had to go through. I think even a lot of people in older generations will say, like, our generation is facing a lot. But I think that we're able to overcome it and that we have great people who honestly are gonna help us get through some of the toughest times.

Lili Tombe:
I think we're not giving enough credit sometimes. The things people like to hate on us a lot. I think, like I said, obviously, there's like the bad apples of our generation, but I think for the most part, it's still the people who honestly are compassionate and wanna see the best for the world and like our country and society. And stuff like that. But.

Question:
Awesome. What's the goal you're currently working towards?

Lili Tombe:
Oh, I plan on starting a podcast soon. I wanted to do it in 2021. And I was gonna do with one of my friends and then that plan kind of fell through. But I've been like where I was like porting episodes and like buying my equipment and like researching things about podcasts for a while. And then I recently got an email from Spotify. They've been doing it, this series of likes, how to build a podcast or whatever, where they've been bringing people in to talk about that. So I'm gonna be attending a seminar for that tomorrow and just get a little bit more insight on that. But I plan on, that's something that I wanna do soon. So hopefully that everything works out.

Question:
Tell me more about this podcast. What is it gonna be about?

Lili Tombe:
So when I originally started, it was mainly just about the things that were going on in the world and about our generation and, like society and just like the struggles that maybe I've overcome and things like that. It's gonna be like a fun little advice podcast. But then also I. With tying things with my faith. That was my plan in 2021. But I think now mainly my plan is just gonna be talking about being, like, a college student and how, like, my high school journey went and, like, just like the new challenges and stuff that I'm overcoming are in the process of doing so. And kind of just be like a candid podcast, like we talk about whatever, maybe there'll be not much of a script, but just talk points and just let things like low.

Question:
Awesome.

Lili Tombe:
I just wanted it to be like real and authentic. So.

Question:
Tell me about your high school experience and what you would talk about in your podcast.

Lili Tombe:
Okay, high school, I un earth unfortunately I met fortunately enough, I went to high school with like the same people that I went to middle school and like the most part elementary school with. So it was very like I was very familiar with everybody around there. But with familiarity comes like. Issues and drama and stuff like that.

Lili Tombe:
But I went into freshman year of high school very fearful and not really, cuz in middle school, I didn't really have the bestest friends. I remember my 13th birthday party, like, nobody showed up. Like, it was really sad. But I, like, went into high school not really knowing what was gonna happen and not really having the strongest, like, Brand Group and stuff like that. But then I ended up meeting some like the best people ever.

Lili Tombe:
But obviously, my freshman year of high schools went Covid hit. So from then up until junior year, I was fully online. I went to class. I think one week out of that whole 2 years span. So just like the mental health struggles that I went through during that time and also like the identity struggles I was going through with like, everything happening with like DLM and Covid and stuff like that. So I talk a little bit about that and then also just like, my academic struggles that I faced my freshman year of high school and how I overcame them. And then now junior year, like I will also, our high school is really involved in student leadership and I did ASB. But I think junior years where it really took off and I was able to be an ASB and be my classes vice president for junior, year, then senior class president senior year. And just like the skills and stuff that I Learned through the leadership opportunities that I've had. And then there's just a lot of little and very big events that happened throughout the course of high school. But I think I maybe other people are facing, but I could probably speak into a little bit. But the original name was I am candid podcast, but I think I'm gonna change it.

Question:
Definitely. Would you have a name for your podcast?

Lili Tombe:
I don't know what yet. That's one thing I need to think about a little bit, but let's see.

Question:
What's your favorite podcasts that you listen to?

Lili Tombe:
I would say right now, let's pull it up. You see, it's my top podcast at the moment.

Lili Tombe:
Okay. My first podcast that I think I ever listened to was pretty basic with Alicia Marie and Remy but I also was, like a huge Emma Chamberlain banner. I still am. So when she came out with stupid genius and all that, I was. And then she changed the name. I'm pretty sure and then also there's save not soft, which is more of like a cushion podcast that I also listen to as well. Let's say those three are like my top, but. But trying to get into some more. And then also Zane and Heath unfiltered. I mostly listen to that one with my sister when I'm in the car, but that one's a good one, too, probably.

Question:
Awesome if you could have any superpower, what would it be?

Lili Tombe:
Super speed. And get from place 1 to place B, or what is it called when you snap your fingers and go? Teleportation. So probably teleportation, actually, that way. Don't arrive just there. What? I'm in Europe. That would be it.

Question:
Have you ever been to Europe?

Lili Tombe:
No, I have not. My sister one like a huge Europe and trip last year and I was at home at school. So I was very jealous. But that but not.

Question:
The way how she get that?

Lili Tombe:
Her, one of her friends was studying abroad in Italy, so she was able to get connections with that. And she does. I don't even know what she did with her school at that time. Just like paused everything or took her laptop with her and was on a completely different time zone, but managed and spent like a month, if not longer, in Europe and living her life while I was doing homework. So. I was hum.

Question:
Crazy. Do you have a favorite season?

Lili Tombe:
Probably four. Fall, I would say I don't like the heat, so probably not summer. Spring gets pretty hot, too. And also like looking at the leaves fall and like everything, although that kind of happens in San Diego, not really, like just. Things change. I think ball is like. And I love Halloween.

Question:
Yes, the pumpkin spice stuff is out already.

Lili Tombe:
More.

Question:
Okay.

Lili Tombe:
I'm not a pumpkin. I, I am like a barista right now. Oh, only for 1 week longer. But everybody's like a huge pumpkin spice fanatic, and ours launch next week. So I'm, I only have a week of dealing with people ordering pumpkin. There's things in the matter there. So I'm excited, but.

Question:
What is yourself there, your favorite way? What's your favorite self care like thing that you do?

Lili Tombe:
Only. Okay. Say like doing face masks and like putting on a movie and like doing my nails. Try to do that at least once every two weeks or something like that and just like unwind and just take time to myself. Would say anything that I get to do by myself, but I don't have tasks that I need to complete is. Like my warm self here instead.

Question:
Okay what is your dream life look like 20 years?

Lili Tombe:
Oh, okay. 20 years down the line, I hope to be living still in San Diego. Hopefully, house prices aren't too crazy. By that, well, they will be living in San Diego. Like owning a house married. With kids, like all my kids, I hope to be born, but. Well, they will be born by then. And being a successful attorney, whatever that looks like, and being able to have a very strong relationship with my family and just being content. Would say like, that's my dream life in 20 years.

Question:
Awesome. You're inspiring me. I'm like, wait, will be a lawyer? Hold on, cuz. I always wanted to be a child advocate attorney for the longest time.

Lili Tombe:
Hum.

Question:
And for some reason, I've just been super out with school that I just, cuz, I go to SCSU right now. I'm a senior and I got a psychology degree because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I know I wanted to work with kids and do stuff. That's why I'm working at a non profit right now.

Lili Tombe:
Hum.

Question:
But I don't know. I'm just so like passionate and I'm just like a go getter. And I just know that I would do really well, but I just know the bar is gonna be, like a lot, and it's a lot of money that I don't have. So I don't know, but.

Lili Tombe:
I know. By the time we would be taking the bar supposed to get way easier, which is like. I heard that they're like taking out a majority of the stuff that we probably don't need to know. So you never know. Maybe it'll be a lot more accessible and hopefully law school gets cheaper. I won't see that happening anytime soon, but I'm definitely gonna be in debt for a while. But you never know.

Question:
So even if I have a psychology degree, I can like, go study for the L set. You can just take the Elsa. Like you just take it.

Lili Tombe:
You just take it.

Question:
That's helpful.

Lili Tombe:
Well, we gotta study no.

Question:
But he doesn't matter what degree you have. It's just like you take.

Lili Tombe:
You can be a math degree and go into law school or Ma.

Question:
I didn't know that.

Lili Tombe:
It's crazy. I didn't know that. I was like, okay, but I could. Literally, you could. I actually was gonna major in psychology, but I randomly decided with polysign. But this. A matter your degree. That's what's super cool about law school. I would say. Get up. Hello.

Question:
And then there's different loans for lost score, right?

Lili Tombe:
I, for whatever reason, I also thought that you couldn't get financial aid when you were in a law school, but apparently that's a lie, too, like you actually can. I recently just researched this. So there's financial aid. There's many different loans that you can take cuz we need lawyers. And so I was like there to give us money to become one, but.

Question:
Wow, that's cool, cuz I love writing.

Lili Tombe:
Hum.

Question:
I'm a big writer. I love helping people. I love public speaking. Oh, my gosh. I love public speaking. I don't know what it is about it, but I just think it's so cool.

Lili Tombe:
There's. But I do.

Question:
Do you like public speaking when for last time you had to public speak?

Lili Tombe:
Honestly, I had a fear for it for a while, but on now, it's like super cool, honestly. But last week, actually, I preached at my church to the youth ministry, so that was like 100 people, a little too bad, but. That was, I think, the last time. And then before them, I got to speak at my graduation. So that was, I think, my biggest proud. For other speaking, the sprinkle, I am.

Question:
Okay, two other questions. I. Tell me a little bit more about your faith. Like, are you Christian?

Lili Tombe:
I grew up Catholic. My. Up until I was like 9 years old. And then we kind of left that. Are not we? My parents kind of stopped taking us to church, and then that's when I think things got pretty bad with me and all my siblings, like mental health. I wasn't really connected to Catholicism at all. I was just drawing on like the giving envelopes like the entire hour. And then a lot of things going on at school when I was getting bullied and just a lot of things are happening. And then randomly, when I was like 10 or 11, my art had called my mom and was, hey, like, but my kids have been going to this church. And I was like a non dominational Christian church. And she was like, I think that you should bring the kids. They have used groups on Fridays. I think they would really enjoy it. And some of them shipped us to Carlsbad for a week. And we like when. There's like randomly the church's like tenure anniversary, so there's like a bunch of parties and activities and sex. Pretty plugged in really early and that's when I kind of stepped away from Catholicism and just started going to a non dominational Christian church.

Lili Tombe:
And I think that was a lot more impactful for me. I was able to, I felt like I had a relationship with God and that just like the things that I was facing weren't, like everything. And that there was something greater. And so I met a lot of amazing people in the process of that. And I've been going to that church for about eight years now. So it's just been a really cool part of my life and.

Question:
Awesome. If you could give advice on something, like say that you are like a role model to people in high school, what would you say? That you're up to? Or three things that you could give advice on would be, you can take the question however you want.

Lili Tombe:
Okay. In terms of specific advice, like right now or just like areas that I would talk about? The biggest piece of advice I would give is just be present in the moment and enjoy every single minute of what you're doing. You're gonna look back and just wish you had a little bit more time with the friends that you did, and like the teachers and the environment that you're able to create. And then secondly, I would say don't take things too seriously. Obviously try and all that stuff, but like your grades and things like that don't determine your self worth or your even your.

Lili Tombe:
I would also say. See, take advantage. Image of the opportunities and resources that you're given. There's people who want to help you and are there to help you, just like, you know, that's why I would say.

Question:
What's the goal you've achieved that you're proud of?

Lili Tombe:
I would say. Overcoming the academic struggles that I did. So I would say like passing high school with a pretty solid GPA. I'm proud of that. I did it, really get good grades. For the longest time I struggled a lot, was in reading programs and stuff through elementary school and all that stuff but then in high school, I really decided to take full responsibility and authority over, like, all of my academics and things that I was doing and get help when needed. And I was able to do a lot better than I ever expected that I was able to do. I was able to graduate and go to now being able to attend a pretty good school.

Question:
That's awesome. What's a skill you'd like to improve?

Lili Tombe:
Probably patience. I'm not a very patient person all the time, so.

Question:
Understandable. I'm not either. What's your favorite movie?

Lili Tombe:
This is always a super hard question to answer.

Lili Tombe:
Hard, I'll just say. What movie do I watch a lot? Not even now.

Lili Tombe:
I like starstruck. It's like a classic Disney movie. I actually know. Let it shine. I would say top silence, but it shines. Very catchy. It's like very cute. And I would say, watch it sometimes when I want to sing along and want to smile, I'll say that. And it's weird because I took film classes in high school, and they had to ask us this question all the time, and I can never answer it. But I'll say let it shine, Disney plus movie.

Question:
Valid choice. Do you have a. Any inspirational quotes that you look up like, that you like?

Lili Tombe:
I. I think I have a couple that I have screenshotted or that I have as wallpapers. Let's see what comes up. See?

Lili Tombe:
Okay. I know where to find it. How long?

Lili Tombe:
I was from a book. Don't know what book it's from. It's a very long one, but I'll just read the beginning of it. But it's just like life is gonna work out perfectly. All the right things are gonna happen. All the right people are gonna come and all the wrong people are gonna leave. Not the part already, but just knowing that life is, regardless of what it looks like now, is gonna eat. Greater, better down the line.

Question:
I like that.

Question:
Have you? Where's your favorite place you've traveled, if you've traveled somewhere?

Lili Tombe:
Australia I went when I was super young, but I still remember it being like very beautiful, very breathtaking. Definitely Australia. I'll travel all over, but I think I was mainly in Brisbane.

Question:
What did you do there was your favorite things you did?

Lili Tombe:
I was there for my aux wedding, but we did a lot of sightseeing and stuff like that. So we went to the Gold Coast, I think is what it's called. So I was able to see that. And then we went to this random amusement park. I don't know what it's called, but there's a really cool, like, Ferris wheel and stuff like that. We did a lot of like, it's just, I just remember it being very green and very pretty and stuff like that.

Question:
Okay. What's a random fact that not many people know about you?

Lili Tombe:
A random fact. Okay. Well, you couldn't be able to tell. If he knew me in person, he probably figured out. But I'm super tall. I'm 6 foot, so it's pretty tall for a girl. That's like a random fact, I guess.

Question:
It's taller than most of the guys that approach me.

Lili Tombe:
I don't mean. Now, definitely have these pros and coupons, but.

Question:
What's the last song you listen to?

Lili Tombe:
Okay, this is where airbuds comes in. Clutch. And let's see, same.

Lili Tombe:
Beach 100%.

Question:
Okay. Why do you like the beach more?

Lili Tombe:
I think it's just, it's very accessible. You don't have to hide for 3 hours to see the pretty view. I also really like swimming in the ocean. It's very fun. And then some tips on the beach. I feel like are way better than sunsets on sunsets. And sunrise is on the mountain, so.

Question:
True.

Lili Tombe:
Hum.

Question:
What about for your. Your favorite high school memory. What was that like?

Lili Tombe:
Oh, okay. I would say it was senior year and it was homecoming week. And ASP had to stay at school until ten PM every single day. And it was, I think, Thursday, and we were building the floats for. The football game the next day. And it was just like, there's people never grade, but I was specifically with obviously the seniors and we randomly somebody started playing 23 by Miley Cyrus. And I don't know who the other person is, Thai Guy or somebody. And we're all just dancing in the hall.

Question:

Question:
Queue. What about your favorite childhood memory?

Lili Tombe:
Okay, let's see.

Lili Tombe:
My favorite child in memory. You might. Oh, okay. I don't know who's my favorite. This is one that I can pick up right now. I was probably like 5. So this, 4,3, I don't know. They just keep retelling me this. So I don't know if this is actually my memory of their retelling of this, but it was Thanksgiving, and I, like, begged my parents for me to be able to pray for dinner.

Question:
Okay.

Lili Tombe:
And I just went and I was like, dear God, I thank you that. And I just basically sort of roasting my siblings in my prayer family something that I think about octave, but I was probably like 4, like at all this.

Question:
How old are you?

Lili Tombe:
And I don't know why I did that, but I did.

Question:
You're roasting them.

Lili Tombe:
Yes, I was like making fun of my sister's teeth. It was.

Question:
Oh, no. Oh, my gosh. That's hilarious. That's funny.

Lili Tombe:
Hum.

Question:
What's the best advice you've ever received?

Lili Tombe:
It's simple. But I would just say, somebody told me like a couple weeks ago, give yourself Grace. And I would say that. Is a good reminder. Simple, but I think I needed it at that time.

Question:
Why did you need.

Lili Tombe:
I think it was like they wrote it in my graduation card. And I was obviously, with graduating and going into college, I was entering a new space. I wasn't gonna be surrounded by all the people that I grew up with and stuff like that. And I think I thought that I had to. I don't know. Like. Maintain who I had been like my entire life or also something wrong with me. I thought I had to be this perfect put together person, and they were just reminding me that, no, you're gonna grow. Entering a new chapter of your life, like you're leaving teenhood and you're about to become like a adult behind yourself. And the problem?

Question:
That's great do you enjoy cooking or do you prefer eating out? What do you like to cook?

Lili Tombe:
I enjoy cutting. It's very fun. It's like a Sudanese thing, but it's called Sambu says. I think in other cultures they call them samosas or something like that. But they're like the pastries that are filled with whatever. So it takes a long time to cook, but I Learned it when I was like 13, and it was like super fun. And I've not whenever, well, I don't cook it often, but when I do, it's the super fun thing that I can also teach my friends how to make and like my other siblings and stuff like that. Okay, pretty good.

Question:
Nice okay, last question is, if you had to describe yourself in three words, it would be?

Lili Tombe:
Hum.

Lili Tombe:
Okay, I would say compassionate. Creative. And I like to think I'm funny. So funny.

Question:
Okay, great. Well, I'm gonna. Do you still have the link for the scheduler thing, like the.

Lili Tombe:
I think so, yes.

Question:
So try and click that and see if you can schedule another one because we do need to do this like a few more times.

Lili Tombe:
Okay.

Question:
Just cuz we do like increment. So it's not like all just like whole, like 3 hours worth of talking and then I can send you the link again to just send me an email and I can do. They're gonna be different questions, different take on the zoom. And then after that's done, you'll get your community. Service hours, and then you'll be a part of the whole process of the app. And everything. So whenever you want, like just maybe next one to two weeks or whenever you're free, I know people are busy, so.

Lili Tombe:
Okay. And then how soon do you want me to schedule this next one?
