Question:
All right, so I'm just gonna be asking you a series of questions and we're just gonna talk and I'm just gonna get to know you a little bit, okay, so first off, what are some of your favorite hobbies would you like to do for fun?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Okay, I feel like a lot.

Question:
What is like your favorite way to spend a weekend look like?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I really like to go out and just need new places. I will be one of my hobbies, spend time with my friends and with the people in love. That's how I spend most of my time like weekends I just either go out with French or I go out with my sister and stuff and then grabbing a specific activity that I do like that I could that would consider a hobby that wouldn't be that.

Question:
Okay, what's your favorite movie.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I think my favorite movie would be like an Avengers movie. I'm a big like Marvel fan and I feel like Infinity War when it first came out, I was in like 7 creators something and I really liked it and like the hype of that movie has lived in my, in me since that day.

Question:
What's your favorite childhood memory?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
My favorite childhood memory would be like going to my grandma's house, cuz we would always go. She doesn't live in the same state I live in, so we would always go in like December. And both of my grandmas live in that city. So you would just go there and just spend time with my cousins and my uncles and my aunts. And all that, I think goes in my favorite memory, memories from my childhood.

Question:
What do you consider your happy place?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I think my happy place is my room. It's just a place where I'm always peaceful at anytime I'm stressed or that I feel like I'm not comfortable, even if it's in my house or outside. I just wanna go to my room, just like lay on my bed and I already forget about everything. I'm like, I can worry about that the next day when I go out of the room.

Question:
I'm the same way.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
That's, I feel like my rooms like my safe place and it's not small. So I have, like, I am, everything has its function in my room.

Question:
What's the place you've always wanted to visit?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I mean, not out like a specific place that I've always wanted to visit, but I know, and my sister mentioned it like not that long ago that she wanna go to Tokyo, and that sounded really nice. So I feel like that's a place I'm like considering right now to maybe go with my sister and spend some time there.

Question:
Cap do you think you're more of a planner or you more spontaneous?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I think I I I'm an overthinker so I think I'm a planner, but I feel like part of being a planner also makes you plan for the unexpected. I mean for me it's like I do plan a lot of like what am I gonna do every day? Like I'm always thinking about what am I gonna do next? But then I'm like, oh, well, nothing ever comes out the way you think it's gonna come out so I've also asked to be always prepare to eat containers and come up with someone with something that like works in that moment. But I feel like maybe more of a planner.

Question:
Do you have a favorite season?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Favorite season? Oh, summer. I just love like the vibes and, oh, I can wear shorts every day and then go to the pool. I really like swimming. I get, I didn't mention it as a hobby cuz I don't do it often, cuz I don't have any like, swimming pool near me. But I really like swimming. Anytime I go into a pool, I'm like not talking to you. I'm just to like my family. I'm, I'm not talking to you right now. I'm listening. I'm always training and like playing.

Question:
He. Are you an introvert or an extrovert?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I'm an extrovert tacos.

Question:
What's your go to? Comfort food. What kind? Like street tacos or.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I feel like any kind, cuz there's like tacos for any occasion. There's like if I'm creating some tacos right now, I just go and get them. Like anything I'm craving. But the ones I crave the most would be Alavada, just like pork with it's marinated in a red sauce. So that's like my favorite one. Like I would, I can always eat that.

Question:
Cool. Do you prefer texting or talking on the phone?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Talking on the phone, cuz sometimes I feel like texting doesn't really show what you're saying in that moment, like the emotion.

Question:
Do you, have you ever had a job?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Do I tell you like what, for? Before my 11th grade, before my junior year, I work that, oh, well, not even before that. From 5th grade to 10th grade, I used to have my own like kind of small business. I used to sell like chips in my neighborhood. And that was like my first job, kind of. And I would, like, from that money, I really, like, I don't think I've ever, like really ask my parents for money for when I go out with my friends and stuff. Cuz I've always had my own. I always had that. And from those years that I've, that had been, like, selling stuff, I, I, one of the guys was like my most he would always have a bite trip for me. He had a burger, like part. And then you used to sell burgers. So he offered me a job over the summer. So that was my first job. And then part of my school, I mean, a part of my school is the work study program, my high school. So I work precision diagnosis rates, which is a lab. So I worked there for my whole junior year, the whole school year. And then after junior year, I got an internship at engineering, which is a biotech lab, and I worked over the summer.

Question:
Wow that's right by us.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
And then this year for the work study program, I'm working in scripts.

Question:
What is what was your favorite for your favorite part of working in the lab this summer?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I got some, my favorite work, I feel like I really like lab.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
So such a great workplace, cuz everyone's, I mean, at least in the ones I work in, everyone's in the mining, their own business, but then also everyone's always willing to help you to do everyone's in their own experiments. Everyone's working on their own, like, assignments in a way. But then if you need help, someone's always there to ask you, oh, do you need this? You need that? And then just describing something new every day really makes it a great job.

Question:
Do you enjoy watching sports?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Not really, but I really like what it creates in people. I don't I'm not very interested in sports, but I do know that when my family hangs out to, like from everyone's happy. So I really like that.

Question:
If money wasn't an issue, how would you make your life different?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I think I would move to the United States so I could like go to school. And I wake up at 5 every day. I don't know. I would. I would be able to do more stuff.

Question:
Who do you ask for advice when you make a difficult decision?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I think my sister would be like the go to for any decision, but also my cousin and my best friend, like, and as soon as something happens, I just let them know. They're very good at supporting me.

Question:
If. How do you feel about taking risks?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I feel like that's like, if you don't take risk, then are you gonna get any reward, like a real reward? I think if you already know what you're getting, then it's like you're not risking anything. I really like risk cuz then you, you're expecting the unexpected like that I'm always taking risk and trying to, even though I'm overthinking like a planner taking risk just open like your view to new places. I feel like that's, or it does like it puts you in the spot of learning without maybe you wanting to.

Question:
Trying to think of another question is there, what are the three most important aspects to support your lifestyle? Like what are the three most important things?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Oh, could you? Oh, explain it more.

Question:
Mine would probably be writing, running and working out and like being kind. Like these three aspects that support my lifestyle all right, describe to a 6 year old what you do in life.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Okay, okay, okay. I think mine would be like comedy. I'm always having fun I feel like if I'm not having fun, I mean, I mean there's always a way to find how to make a joke or how to make everything happy. And then always be willing to help. I think that's one of my, the most important. I'm always tryna help people and always finding ways to help them. Cuz that's just whatever you give comes back to you. So I find out, I find that very important in my life. And just friendship, I think that will be the third one.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
But I didn't, I would tell them like I go to school, to big boy school from Monday to Friday and one day of, one day a week I, I work to get my, to be part of my school. And then on the weekends, I really like spending time with my friends, maybe be more, I not procrastinate like what I have to do is I have to do it right now I've a lot, a little bit more order in my life than that.

Question:
What is one life lesson that you think everyone should know?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
That, I mean, I, I'm saying this like everyone in my, like receiving my life or like around my age, just like we're young. It's okay to make mistakes. It's like you can just, it'll pass. Don't be so stressed about the future given the importance it has, but don't make it super big when it's not.

Question:
What is your biggest fear that you've overcome?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
My biggest fear.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Feel like coming out, like I, this was like last year was my first year in the American School, like the whole vibe and the whole, everything was just so different that this year I'm, I feel like everyone knows I'm out and I just see that no one really cares about it. So now I'm like, oh, what I do this before, like no one cares. And I even told my friends from my husband, like they know and I just feel so much free, how much better I think I can.

Question:
Do you think you could be an advocate for people that haven't come out yet? How would you explain or how, what would, what advice would you give to people that haven't.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Don't rush it. Like you have to do it on your own time I'm on purpose. And like sadly someone outed me, but it just you find out over the time that what other thing doesn't really matter when you're living your true, when you're living your life. Other people like just they're not important. And you have to focus on being yourself and being honest yourself so you can really enjoy what you're doing.

Question:
I agree. What do you think that you could give advice on in terms of your own life and what you've been through? Like, give me some things that you might be able to help others with.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Motivation. I feel like I'm very good at motivating people. Just having that energy of like, it sounds hard, it's gonna, you're gonna be tired, but it's gonna be worth it. I feel like most of the challenges that I'm facing right now, a lot of people couldn't like their mindset doesn't let them like go through them or wouldn't let them go through it. But I really like helping my friends and be like, I know that it's 5 in the morning, but we have to get the trolley at six, 30 and you have to go to school. Like you have to wake up. No, I'm rich. I think that's an advice I can give anyone.

Question:
We see. Are you a morning person or night person?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I'm a, I think I'm a, I would be like a, I don't know, cuz I, I don't usually stay up late so nine person, but maybe a morning person. I just like the, the sunshine and all, everyone's happy the morning a joke, even if it's like a bad joke, this is funny.

Question:
What's a small thing that never fails to make you happy?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Like for me, anything funny, my senior town let me think, let me, cuz I don't really like go to a lot of places, but I feel like my neighborhood, it's so nice cuz it's my house and then have some friends there.

Question:
You have a favorite spot in your city or town.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Then my family's there and then all around it, literally just walking like walk distance, not even three minutes walking. There's bunch of places like Tacos, Wings, there's like I there's four pharmacies walking distance from my house. Cuz I just feel like it's a tiny town. My favorite spot.

Question:

Question:
Do you, who's your role model? Old is your sis.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
It always made me better. I don't feel like there's been any incidents when she had done anything to like bring me down. She's always doing everything to make me grow. And the way she has always been like so old, open to me, talk to me about everything that happens. I think that has helped me like my maturity level, my dream life.

Question:
All right, let's see, what's your dream life look like?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I don't really have a super focus idea on what I want my dream life to be. So maybe living in the place where I can be comfortable, have a job I like a lab I really love. And I'm not just living close to my family and being able to maybe see them, having a distance. I can see them every weekend. You can make that.

Question:
If you're looking to start a friendship or a relationship? What are the qualities that you look for in a friend or a relationship?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Loyalty I feel like most people don't get what it is. They know about it and they like talk about it but they don't they're not really like loyalty human, but and I feel like that's like the basis of any friendship.

Question:
I. Any other qualities or just loyalty?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Oh, okay, just like honesty. I mean if you really have a friend, you're not you're not gonna have a you're not gonna be friends with someone that's gonna judging. So you I don't see why you would be afraid to be honest with a friend cuz it's not someone that's looking to like, do anything to make you feel bad in any way. When people are honest and people tell me about what they're going through, I really value that cuz it means they're gonna do the same for me.

And I, I mean, it's become like tradition that I'm the one that like, pose the, the like gift giving. So I like take the boxes, just give them to each one and explain who gave it to them. And it's just open. I really like Christmas.

Question:
How would you describe your parenting style? If you were a parent, like, how do you think you would be.

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Just I'm very proud of this past year, my junior year and all I did in this year. It was my first year in American school, was my first time transferring school, like 10 years. So just going into the school and then excelling at everything, having a 4.0 GPA, taking 3 APS. I took 4 AP test and then by the end of the year, I got honorable on every quarter. And then at the end of the year, I got recognized by two teachers. They give class awards like that type of award or just like they recognize one of the students from each class. So I feel like just of me being like a total outsider to becoming a big part of the school. I feel like I'm a big part of the school. And like I'm part of ASP, I'm part of the student ambassadors, I've part of many different clubs. Like just me being able to adapt so easily to that makes me proud of myself.

Question:
If you could hire someone to help you, would it be cleaning, cooking or something else?

When people don't listen, when you tell someone like don't do this and then they do it and then they're do that, like or in classmen like students don't listen to a teacher. I'm just listen like, oh, it's not that hard. We're all going through it. We're all annoyed in this test is don't make it more annoying for everyone. Don't make the teacher with people he just said just cuz you're not listen.

Outdoor peace of mind.

Question:

Oh oh peace of mind okay, cuz again, if I'm not if I don't feel peaceful then I'm not a I don't feel prepared to help anyone else. You can't if you're not and you don't take care of yourself then how are you gonna take care of someone else?

Question:

Back in time, I would maybe go to when my parents had my sir when she was born. This is the year when she was younger. I don't see any point of my lap where I'm like, oh, I would I wanna change this, right? I would just like to see everyone when they were younger.

Like with my friends, I'm like, what, how you what you're going through kind of like how I can help you, how I've been through, maybe I've been through something similar and give tips about that or just funny stuff. Just like having a conversation with what's happening in the moment and just be like, oh, and this happen and oh, and then someone just fell and then help them and then be like, oh, that was unexpected. And that's funny.

Question:
Okay. How do you define your family?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I think my family is like my family, my I'm talking about the people that live in my house, which is my mom, my dad, my sister and I. I feel like we're all helping each other and we're all always trying to like make the best out of the situation from how my, what my parents tell about how they met each other and how their story, like how they grew and when they got married and all the things they like been through, bum common factor and all of that is just them trying to help each other out is like always say, such a non selfish attitude that I think motivates and makes my family like table.

Question:
How do you deal with conflict or argument?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I always like to think about it cuz maybe in the moment you can be a little like, you can say the wrong thing when you're reacting in normal man. I always think like to think about it and then have a conversation about what happened. Cuz talking is like the only way you can really make sure everything's resolved.

Question:
What is the BIS biggest personality change you've seen in yourself?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Myself, I feel like from 10th grade to 11th grade, in 10th grade, I went to a school or everyone was, oh, everyone was, everyone in that school was like super rich. So I feel like that attitude of trying to best people really faded away the first week I was in my new school. Oh, I don't need to impress anyone. I don't need to act like I'm something I'm not cuz me being myself already impress people.

Question:
What is a relationship deal breaker for you?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
Like people break that trust. When people don't trust you, when you, when I see that a friend is like, believing stuff that someone else said and they don't, like, they don't come in, that they, they get mad before they come and ask me about the situation. I feel like that's a deal breaker for me on you didn't value my friendship to care.

Question:
Are you more of a materialistic person or an emotional person? Like, would you rather someone, like, make something or would you rather someone, like, give you something you've been really wanting?

Mauro Gutiérrez:
I feel like an emotional person. I've never been really like, I don't know, again, my parents have never raised me to think about any brands or think anything expensive as something like coldy or something that I. So I don't really care about like fancy stuff or anything that type. So I always value more like the feeling of like, oh, you gave me a gift that means a lot more to me than what you gave me.

Question:
Can you, if you could give the world any advice or say something to the world right now, what would you say?
