Adrina:
Speaking of high school, you just graduated high school, right? What were your, like, 3 favorite memories from high school?

Reagan Ericson:
We're like the first girls team to ever do it. It was just, it was a really fun experience. And we all got to go on a bus, insane hotel. I think just like actually qualifying. We didn't think we're going to. And then this one girl on a team who normally wasn't like getting those times, like she did really well and we were able to go. So that was, it was really fun after that cuz I was like, return to Linda. And then another favorite memory. I really liked my senior English class. I just that teacher I took like a normal English class. Cuz I want to like have it been easy thing? Definitely. I don't know if it's what I got from this teacher, but I think it was just, it was like a really fun experience with everyone in the class, someone was involved. And I think after Covid, my school kind of lost that. And then another fun experience would be soccer. I didn't really to like the way my coach like top, I think the girls the season and we just have really good community and we do a lot of stuff like outside. I think that was another fun experience.

Adrina:
What about any dances that you're like from.

Reagan Ericson:
Prom was fun. It was kind of a lot of drama. We went with like two friend groups, but I think it was fun. And my friend got broken up with. It was like fun getting ready and stuff for it. But it I don't think it was one of my favorite memories.

Adrina:
There's always something that happen during prom. It's just some, like someone, someone, some couples fighting, someone's not happy, like someone's breaking up. It's like this whole. I remember that.

Reagan Ericson:
We just want this one group that was just, oh, they're like wouldn't leave on the time with a plan, which was fun. But we're like really stuff to do after prom. It was really fun. And I was just, I was a lot of money and a lot of stress at the same time though.

Adrina:
What's a goal you've achieved that you're proud of?

Reagan Ericson:
A goal I've achieved, I think getting into school like s going to college like my first year, I think is something I like worked a lot towards. And like not going to community, I think that was probably something that I normally do. I think I worked a lot to save money just to be able to make it happen. I think the most part of that goal.

Adrina:
Awesome. Do you like to cook or bake more?

Reagan Ericson:
I like to bake. I did a lot more during Covid I like it to make a glamin bars.

Adrina:
Will you? I think you ended.

Reagan Ericson:
Where'd you say.

Adrina:
I think everyone did like drink Covid.

Reagan Ericson:
But other than that, I don't do much or they have. Did you make like the Toll House like chocolate chip cookie recipe. Not the Toll House, the the Hilton one and I like made that during Covid.

Adrina:
No.

Reagan Ericson:
That's like the one I like will still make sometimes.

Adrina:
What is that?

Reagan Ericson:
It's like the cookies give you at the hotel. Apparently if you stay there, they're really good though. They're like it's you like chop up almonds really thinly which normally don't like that.

Adrina:
Oh, yes, I know you're talking about. So you can make those, what's a random fact that not many people know about you?

Reagan Ericson:
I mean, hi. When we have like pen pals in England, my family so like I like got to go freshman year just because of root my it was like my great grandma accidentally sent a letter and so my whole family has like pen pals was just like friends in England.

Adrina:
Is that like writing thing? Oh, that's cool, do you prefer digital books or physical books?

Reagan Ericson:
Physical books. I will I have like a Kindle app on my phone if I'm really bored, but I if I try to read on my phone, then I just get distracted. So definitely physical look, sunny, just have it be sunny, blue skies, just like a fun nice day that just makes you wanna kind of go outside.

Adrina:
What's your favorite type of weather?

Adrina:
What's your favorite spot in your city or town are? You're from San Diego, right? Like you live here?

Reagan Ericson:
I think it's like a look at right by Swami's. But it's really fun to go. And then I'm just like hanging out with friends or just to park there and to walk down to the beach. Cuz it's hard to get there from cuz there's like a railroad, this like a little underpass. But I think there's fun.

Adrina:
I've never been to swamis, but I've heard about it. Is it cool?

Reagan Ericson:
It's really cool. There's a lot of seaweed there right now though, like the beach. But just like that overlook is really pretty and like the palm trees and the tiktoes, but definitely go.

Adrina:
Cool.

Reagan Ericson:
It's.

Adrina:
I always go to LA Hoya beaches. Like I don't know, I Sunset Cliffs or no, I've been there, but I have never jumped cuz I'm too scared.

Reagan Ericson:
Oh, do you have you done like the LA Hoya Cove where you like Jump Off I think.

Adrina:
But I've just heard of horror stories like if you just jump the wrong way or if you hit a rock or, I don't know, I don't wanna just.

Reagan Ericson:
And right, I was company, small, fun.

Adrina:
Do you enjoy traveling alone or with company? Would you wanna travel alone sometime? Like try it out?

Reagan Ericson:
I thought about it, but I don't know if I trust myself that much. I think I would have to do a lot of planning. And what I wanna do is like go backpack or something, which I don't think is that safe to do alone. So just for safety reasons, really, really.

Adrina:
I had never been out of the country before, but I decided to go to Europe this summer alone. No one. And it was actually is so awesome. It was actually like my favorite experiences I've ever had and I made many friends.

Reagan Ericson:
Would you go?

Adrina:
Like, I went to, well, I would recommend studying abroad because I did like a program, so I was forced to meet people. But I went to Copenhagen, like Denmark, and it was like such a random spot, but it was like one of the coolest places. There was like beaches, like no one would know that there's beach in Denmark, but it was really pretty. Like most, some of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen. Awesome community, like everyone super sweet, likes everyone speaks English. And then with few of my friends that I made at the program, we booked a trip to Amsterdam for a weekend. We went to Amsterdam and then when I was coming home, I stopped in Paris and then I like saw the Eiffel Tower and everything and I was literally outside the Eiffel Tower with an umbrella by myself. It was pouring rain and I was just like, what am I doing? But it's just like it was really fun.

Reagan Ericson:
At school.

Adrina:
Definitely recommend traveling alone if you've never done it because it definitely teaches you a lot of stuff about yourself that I don't think I can think. It just, it made me more like willing to do stuff by myself, which I've never been. Like, I'm always that person that needs to be around people. Like I'm super extroverted. But for that it was just like not, you get to a point in your college career where you're like, I'm too dependent on others and I need to do this.

Reagan Ericson:
That's cool. I would not, like, I think I would be scared to do that. Like, how do you get yourself to just, like, go do that?

Adrina:
Like it's just kind of a thing that I hit me and I was like, I'm just really dependent on people and my friends. And I'm like, once you graduate college, you have to realize that you're on your own now and you might have to move somewhere alone. And I think just traveling alone is a, it's a good step in the right direction for me.

Adrina:
I'm thinking about where I'm gonna go after college. I have no idea. I wanna get a good job, but I don't know where that's gonna be. I don't know what the future entails for me I might as well, like, travel alone, see if I can just do it and be happy by myself. And like, by the time I'm ready to get a job and settle down somewhere, at least I know that I could do it by myself and be okay.

Reagan Ericson:
That's really cool. Definitely something I might think about. Do you go to UCSD?

Adrina:
No, I go to SCSU.

Reagan Ericson:
Okay, it's cool. I almost done.

Adrina:
UCSC is right by my work. I'm actually, like, on the campus right now, technically, but what we're saying in my this year, I'm excited, but I'm also sad because college do not take it for granted cuz it's so fun.

Reagan Ericson:
Oh, when you gradually. Oh, nice.

Adrina:
Like school is definitely like a priority but like do the crazy stuff, have a fun social life like make friends do crazy stuff of cuz it's you only get one chance to do it for four years, and it's like it's over and then real life hits you and you're like oh no, I have to be an adult now. But I don't know I didn't rush a sorority but I don't know. I feel like I would have if I didn't play water polo cuz I was on the water polo team for 2 years. But I would recommend rushing and I would recommend joining because I feel like you can get so many jobs through sorority.

Reagan Ericson:
Do you recommend? I was thinking not like actually joining, but just rushing to just like, I don't know, one of my roommates is doing it, the other one isn't. But really.

Adrina:
It's actually crazy. So many girls at my school just know, like, all those sorority girls, like, we're CEOs of new companies, like, and there's just so many connections. It's crazy. And they always have career fairs and information. And like, someone told me that sororities have special tutors that know the teachers of every subject and have the test answer is for every subject.

Reagan Ericson:
Oh, I have been.

Adrina:
And what, like, let me join just for that. But I don't know what are you most excited for college?

Reagan Ericson:
Yes, I think it's gonna be like a cool experience to kind of live on my own.

Adrina:
Like about?

Reagan Ericson:
It's like 5 hours away too, so I think ask me really fun and I think just like going out and just, I don't know, having fun, kind of both.

Adrina:
Are your parents pretty chill or they like stricter?

Reagan Ericson:
Like they're a little bit more strict. I think they're very, my dad's like religious and stuff, but I think they're more definitely more strict a little bit.

Adrina:
Sorry. Excited like little freedom, what's your favorite holiday and why?

Reagan Ericson:
Thank you weapon.

Reagan Ericson:
Like Thanksgiving, my family like most of the time we had last year cuz we had like the cross country thing. My brother didn't want to cuz he thought he was gonna make it, but then but anyways, normally we go to Rosarito with my entire family and like stay on the beach. We, I don't like stay with my cousins and like the normal, like the condo that I saw him sad lives in. But then it's a, it's like call for those polyconos and then those gavionis and we just like rent out houses, probably like my one, my cousin Mina, her family runs one and then my family normally does. And then everyone just kind of piles them together. Which one?

Adrina:
Fun what's a talent you wish you had?

Reagan Ericson:
Thanksgiving.

Reagan Ericson:
Talent I wish you had. I wish I was flexible or a little less clumsy.

Adrina:
Okay let me think. What's like, one of your favorite memories with your little siblings?

Reagan Ericson:
Memories, I think just hanging out on the house with them. Over Covid, we were just like all together all the time and we just got like a new trampoline or it's like a small one, but I think that's really fun. My little sister always after dinner, she wants to go just like champagne, trampoline, like little games. I think that's fun.

Adrina:
Same with my little sister. We have a trampoline. We also have chickens in our backyard, really like live chickens.

Reagan Ericson:
Oh, oh, careful, I'm a Libra.

Adrina:
And they're running around and my little sister will literally grab the chicken by the head and just pick it up and shake it. I'm like, put it down. Like, got afraid of anything. We also have a bunny and she'll just like pick up their bunny and shake it. And I'm like, oh my God, like it stop. Like, it's kind of scary. But what's your sign? What's your, like, sign? And then do you think that you align with what your sign says about you?

Reagan Ericson:
I'm not really industriology, but my second one kind of is and she like over it. And she think it's two things in aligns with me. I trust your judgment, but, I'm not really into that campaign. So, and probably just like younger kids like I baby, I nanny for two different families and then my younger siblings, I think just like, I don't know, just from what I've seen just like parenting grown up.

Adrina:
Okay what's a topic you can talk about for hours? Like, what's something that you're really passionate about?

Reagan Ericson:
I think I talk a lot about that with my stepmom.

Adrina:
I'm trying to think your question. Ask you what's the skill you'd like to teach others?

Reagan Ericson:
Well with my friends we, I get them to go out or go running into the gym with me and stuff. I think I'm more the friend that likes like get everyone to go do stuff. Everyone's most my friends have just moved to college or two of them move to LA so that we found that like moved into apartment. But I think just like to go out and to make plans, be creative, I think.

Adrina:
What brings you in a good mood? Like, what brings you to have a good mood?

Reagan Ericson:
I think just like family and friends, I very sick whenever I going to work. I like my three close friends, whenever one of them is working, I think it's fun just kind of like talk to them. And, I think I would have applied for more scholarships earlier or something different.

Adrina:
Is there anything you would do differently in your life, and what would it be?

Reagan Ericson:
I don't know if I would really change much, just cuz I like where I'm at. And I feel like a lot of things I can change and do.

Adrina:
What's the nicest compliment you've ever received and from who?

Reagan Ericson:
How from the one of the families of babysit 4, I've been babysitting for like sophomore year, but she was just like, oh, she's wants me to stay. She's calls me like a part of their family. And I think just like being included in that and getting that close to another family, I think it's really nice. I don't know if it's like a compliment, but I don't know. Probably that.

Adrina:
What advice would you give to your 10 year old self?

Reagan Ericson:
Just like to put yourself out there and not, I think I was kind of a serious kid. So just like not take things as seriously.

Adrina:
What did you love as a child that you don't anymore?

Reagan Ericson:
I love this child. Probably I lived with my dad and my brother for a while, so I don't know. Things got pretty gross. So like it's because just not like Girls Voice probably it's but pretty much the same things. Like I've always known and wanted to do something like, I don't know, or hard or cool for a career, which I'm trying to do now. And then I don't know, I think I've kind of set myself up to like be where I wanna be.

Adrina:
2 favorite drink.

Reagan Ericson:
My favorite drink a like an ice caramel market really, if I go get one later.

Adrina:
Starbucks just launched their pumpkin spice today I was at Starbucks this morning and the line was like wrapped around the building cuz of that.

Reagan Ericson:
Really?

Adrina:
And I was like why is it so busy?

Reagan Ericson:
Is it worth it?

Adrina:
The ladies like, oh, you want this? I didn't get it cuz I when a tea because if I drink coffee super early, I get really jittery and I don't feel good.

Reagan Ericson:
Oh oh, I probably go like travel broad somewhere, just like the first quarter or I think it'd be cool just like maybe to even go to school like England.

Adrina:
I don't know cuz I don't eat a lot in the morning. Cuz I'm not really like that hungry. And when I just drink coffee like on an empty stomach, it just hurts my stomach. So I just drink tea. But in if money wasn't an issue, how would you make your life different?

Reagan Ericson:
I like to when I was there. And then also I wanted to go to school in Colorado, and so I think I maybe go there. I also got whitelisted at Vanderbilt, so I think I'd maybe, I don't know if I'd wanna go there cuz the class sizes are so small, but I think I like my school, but I would definitely just travel more. Anything.

Adrina:
I think Apollo is a really good choice. I love being there. It's so fun. Everyone there is nice. It's like there's beach, there's forest, mountains. Like it's a gray area. And there's little downtown slow, so cute. Like it's 7.

Reagan Ericson:
It's really cool.

Adrina:
It's, what have you never done before?

Reagan Ericson:
Now. As soon as I like visited, I accepted that. Like I accepted it. I went to Montana too. I was like, I'm leaving to go snowboard. But I really liked.

Reagan Ericson:
It's adorable. Rings. I need you to get it to my computer. You guys have something? Okay. Okay. I'm just going to go open. Nobody said okay. Sorry. What was the question?

Adrina:
What I forgot what have you never done before?

Reagan Ericson:
What if I never done before? I've never lived on my own. That's make a really cool experience. Or another thing I've never done. I know I'm, I'm, I like to try a lot of some very adventurous person, just especially cuz my dad and my family. But I'm very open to new things. Just probably living on my own.

Adrina:
How do you relax yourself when you're stressed?

Reagan Ericson:
When like to read or I go for runs, I like listening to music and probably the runners high and just kind of just like the long runs when I am in trip to them just like having once you reach the past 2 mile point it's kind of like meditation almost and you think that's, I normally run.

Adrina:
Feel like, what's your favorite part about running? Like the runner is high. Like listening to music.

Adrina:
What's your mile pace like? What do you usually run?

Reagan Ericson:
It honestly just really depends on how much caffeine or my music. I ran the Marathon like under 9 minute pace and the whole Marathon but that is I didn't think I was gonna be only do that but I had a lot of those gel packs so you just, my.

Adrina:
The whole Marathon.

Adrina:
Girl, Jeez, that's so fast. I forgot that you did cross country. But still, that's like, could not be me.

Reagan Ericson:
No. Oh, I was I thought I went into it like the first half way too fast. So I was like, there's the Boston Marathon time, qualified time, and I was like, oh, I can do it. And I was on track to do it. And then I just think it was like the 17th mile, like my knee gave out.

Adrina:
The 17th mile. That would make sense but which Marathon did you do?

Reagan Ericson:
No, I heard I did the San Diego one I forgot is called.

Adrina:
Where was it?

Reagan Ericson:
The whole thing was just like kind of spur of the moment. I'm gonna.

Reagan Ericson:
Well, it was a rock and roll one. Pajamas.

Adrina:
Okay, awesome.

Reagan Ericson:
It was a rock and roll Marathon.

Adrina:
All right, well, that's basically it. I will send you an email if I need any more information, but I think we're just gonna see how much we data we need. I'm gonna put this all into a transcript and then we'll see if we need to talk more. But thank you so much. I hope slow is fun. I'll let Ping know that you join today and I will be in touch.

Reagan Ericson:
Thanks so much. Good luck with last year school and everything.
