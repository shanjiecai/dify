JAMES CORDEN: We sit down, we ordered, and my wife explained that she has a serious food allergy, right? So when everybody's meals came, my wife was given the food that she was allergic to.

KYLIE MAR: On "The Late Late Show with James Corden" Monday, Corden addressed being briefly banned from the popular Balthazar restaurant in New York City for reportedly being abusive to the staff. Corden gave his side of the story and said he regrets his actions.

JAMES CORDEN: As her meal came wrong to the table the third time, in the heat of the moment I made-- I made a sarcastic, rude comment, right, about cooking it myself, and it is a comment I deeply regret.

KYLIE MAR: Corden said he left the restaurant that day not thinking he'd done anything wrong.

JAMES CORDEN: I didn't call anyone names or use derogatory language. I've been walking around thinking that I hadn't done anything wrong, right? But the truth is, like I have. I made a rude-- rude comment, and it was wrong. It was an unnecessary comment. It was ungracious to the server.

KYLIE MAR: Corden said he called the owner and apologized for the incident and hopes to be able to apologize to the staff in person someday.

JAMES CORDEN: That I've ever upset anybody ever, it was never my intention. It just wasn't. And I love that restaurant. I love the staff there. I hope I'm allowed in again one day so when I'm back in New York I can go there and apologize in person.

KYLIE MAR: And finally, Corden shared some of the online backlash he got after the story came out.

JAMES CORDEN: "When I become president of hell, I'm going to make super hell and put James Corden in it." [BLEEP] "James Corden so hard. God, I hate Carpool Karaoke so much I don't even sing to myself anymore." And my personal favorite which was, "Wait, James Corden has a wife?"
