after living in los angeles for roughly

six years now i consider myself a bit of

a local so when a friend of mine moved

to town recently i decided that i would

show him some of los angeles hidden gems

all while traveling in the style of a

true native angelino

ah

there he is

hey

hey

this is subtle where's the range rover i

don't always drive around in a range

hop on up okay you know us roars we

don't carry cash

the first time i've been on open top bus

is it really no no not really allowed to

you've never been on an open top bus i

was in london i always see them cruising

around tourists i was like you know

they'll be really good fun because once

you when you live in an area

this part of la that we're in now since

you moved here no it's been logged down

yeah this is the first time i've had a

chance to see la

barbara but i do feel like you might

need a base in los angeles and i

actually found

the perfect house have you ever watched

the fresh prince of bel-air

yes this here right there is the house

from the fresh prince of bel-air

the very house

that will smith turns up to is good

enough for the fresh prince it's good

enough for a real prince okay do you

remember the song

this is a story all about how my life

got flipped turn upside down now take a

minute

sit right there right there i'll tell

you how i became the prince of the town

called that look

see it's made for you

hi

are you the owner of this house yes

this is the house from the fresh prince

of bel-air right it is how much would

you sell this house

to harry and megan paul

well think about how cool

it would be to live to go i'm a prince

i live in the house of the fresh prince

expect that i didn't expect a toilet

something quite serious okay tell me i'm

here with the big man

no

that

that is the house from the fresh prince

of bel-air

and i think this is where you should

live i don't think there's anything

cooler

already used the bathroom that's how a

homie feels

well that's wonderful i think we've done

enough moving

doubt in my mind that this is where you

know where you were calling your house

now no you're not my wife

[Laughter]

me and house see ya bye bye i think

that's a lot i think we're done thank

you so much that's it we gotta go we're

gonna go see you soon

[Applause]

[Music]

so when did you know that megan was

the one

the second date i was starting to think

wow this is pretty special

why

where did you go because we just

it wasn't so much where we went it was

just the fact the way that we we hit it

off with each other and we were just so

comfortable in each other's company

dating with me or with any member of the

royal family i guess

is kind of flipped upside down

all the dates become

dinners or watching the tv or chatting

at home

and then eventually once you become a

couple then you venture out to dinners

to the cinema and everything else so

everything was done back to front with

us so actually we got to spend

an enormous amount of time just the two

of us rather than going to friends

houses or out for dinner where there

were other distractions there were no

distractions and that was great it was

an amazing thing we went from zero to

to 60 like in the first in the first two

months

and what's a regular night in

like for you both um depending on how

the day's been how busy it's been

we'll do archie's audrey's tea give him

bath read him a book

put him down go downstairs

meg might cook a meal might order a

takeaway go upstairs sit in bed

turn the tv on and watch some jeopardy

maybe watch a little bit of netflix and

how do you feel about the crown

um they don't pretend to be news

it's fictional

but it's loosely based on the truth yes

of course it's not strictly accurate of

course

but loosely but you do think loosely it

does feel like it gives it gives you a

rough idea about what what that

lifestyle what the pressures of putting

duty and service above family and

everything else

what what can come from that i'm way

more comfortable with the crown

than i am seeing the stories written

about my family or my wife or myself

because it's the difference between that

is obviously fiction take it how you

will

but this is being reported on as fact

because

you're supposedly news yeah i have a

real issue with that who would you like

to see play you daniel daniel lewis

damien lewis damien lewis damien lewis

is a great shout out

i think damian lewis is you and me as

william

that's casting

it's not great casting but it is

constant

[Music]

how are you finding fatherhood my son is

now just over a year and a half he is

hysterical he's got the most amazing

personality he's already putting three

four words together he's already singing

songs what was his first word uh

crocodile crocodile three syllables

that's a big word

interesting my my grandmother asked

asked us what art she wanted for

christmas and meg said a waffle maker

she sent us a waffle maker for archie

so breakfast now meg makes up a

beautiful like organic mix yeah in the

waffle maker

flip it

out it comes

he loves it and now i have waffles of

breakfast but a yogurt bit of jam on top

i don't know if that's the right thing

to do but of berries maybe a little bit

of honey maybe some syrup sorry you're

glossing over the fact that i cannot for

the life of me imagine the queen

ordering a waffle maker to be sent to

santa but i can't get my head around

i don't even know how to comment on that

actually wakes up in the morning

literally goes

does the queen know how to use a zoom

uh yes

both my grandparents this is crazy we've

zoomed in a few times they've seen

archie running around

but my my grandfather instead of like

pressing leave meeting yes he just goes

he's like bye bye as i'm pressing like

he just lean forward goes

i'm like okay bye

and then now that you live here

what is life

like

or what are you excited for it to be

out of lockdown

i have no idea like

a slightly different version but a

continuation of what we were doing back

in the uk anyway

right it's going to be it's that's what

that's what our life my life is always

going to be about public service and

megan signed up to that and the two of

us enjoy doing that trying to

trying to bring some compassion and you

know trying to make people happy and

trying to change the world in any small

way that we can it's such a monumental

decision

to have walked away from the royal

family why did you feel that that was

necessary and the right thing to do for

you and your family it was never it was

never walking away it was it was

stepping back rather than stepping down

right um

you know it was a really difficult

environment as i think a lot of people

saw we all know what the british press

can be like and it was destroying my

mental health i was like this is toxic

yeah

so i did what any husband and what only

father would do is like i need to get my

family out of here but we never walked

away and as far as i'm concerned

whatever decisions are made on that side

i will never walk away i will always be

contributing

but my life is public service so

wherever i am in the world it's going to

be the same thing

[Music]

now

because i know

we're both a long way away from home

your life now is very different to your

life back home and particularly when

you're in the military oh an open top

bus yeah that's great so i've actually

arranged

a little summing to take you back to

your roots

a little taste of military life

okay as a gift really from me to you and

i'm already regretting saying that i'll

be part of it

but if you follow me
