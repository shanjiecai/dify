Like I think it's easily for me to talk to, to other people, like making new friends, like not like talking through strangers, but just like interacting with people out of know and then making new friendships. And it's something I enjoy. I think I like better being surrounded by people and like having people I can count on or rely on. And I don't know, I think I also get bored if I'm alone. So I don't know. I have always had a lot of friends and I like meeting new people. Also like people from all around the world. I also like traveling. So like people with different cultures and different I don't know, way of thinking so I can learn more if like there the way they think and the way they see the world.

Maria Noriega:
It's summer, because I don't like the cold weather I don't know.

Question:
Why do you like summer more than the other ones?

Maria Noriega:
Just for me, I think my body cannot handle it. Like I have always live in really hot places if it's a little cool, I don't it. I don't like wearing all the jackets and the layers. I think it's uncomfortable for me. So I just, I get cold really easily. And when it's summer, I think I can do more activities outdoors. I can walk for a run. I can go to the beach. I can go surfing. I can, I don't know, just being elders is more pleasant for me when it's hot.

Question:
Okay. Are you a morning routine person?

Maria Noriega:
Yes, I think I like waking up early because that way I feel I'm more productive, yes.

Question:
Do you have a specific morning routine?

Maria Noriega:
So I usually woke up at 7 a m. And then I do my breakfast, I take a shower, I brush my tea, get ready. And then around 8:20, I do yoga and then I start my classes at around 11. And then after I got to the gym and then like just go on with my day.

Maria Noriega:
The first time I played bingo, it was like three years ago. It was like a in my past college, they used to do this activities like late night activities for a student. So I don't know for me it was for like old people. But then I play it and I just like, I think I get really excited. There's like a lot of trail like, I don't know, I'm I think I'm really competitive and I like winning. So it's just fun.

Question:
What's the most interesting place you've traveled to? Because I know you said you like to travel.

Maria Noriega:
I don't know if, oh, for me it was the most interesting. I like Italy a lot just because they have a lot of culture. And I live, I like, sorry, art and museums. So I had experience to go to different churches and museums. And in the past they had like a lot of his 3 and really good artist, which is like a really cool place to see like all these paintings and sculptures and everything. And also the architecture, it's really cute.

Question:
That's. I bet do you have a favorite quote or saying that you like?

Maria Noriega:
Traffic.

Maria Noriega:
I don't know, maybe I don't know if it goes like this exactly, but after the storm comes to Rainbow, I just like staying positive every time, even when things go wrong. So I don't know, I, I'll, I always like to think about that because sometimes you're really stress or sad and you think everything's going wrong, but you just have to like stay calm for a little bit and know after all the bad things, something's good about to, to come for you.

Question:
I like that quote, too. What's a goal you're currently working towards?

Maria Noriega:
I think I'm, I'm going. I mean, I started maybe like a year ago and I'm still working on it for, but being more organized. I have a weekly schedule and I try to kind of every day just so I can be more organized. And I like being productive to sell. I don't think I'm perfect yet, but I'm just getting better at it.

Question:
What's the way that you've worked on it? Like stayed a little bit more organized?

Maria Noriega:
Well, I usually every Sunday I plan like my days. I have like a weekly payment planner. So I just write like what time I'm gonna wake up or what time I'm gonna study, what time I'm gonna work, go workout, what time I'm gonna do my homework, when I know, for example, if I said that I was gonna go to Jimmy at 5, then it's 5 and I know I have to go. And then if it's 7, I know at 7 I have to take a shower. So like that way I'm not like, oh, I have nothing to do and I just chilly know, like I think time is precious. So I just like doing something productive at every time, every little time I have.

Question:
Give a planner.

Maria Noriega:
I do, I do.

Question:

Maria Noriega:
I like watching basketball just because my dad, he used to play basketball when he was younger. So he usually takes me to the basketball games. But I also like watching soccer a lot.

Question:
What's your favorite type of dessert?

Maria Noriega:
I would say I stream or cookies.

Question:
What kind of ice cream do you like.

Maria Noriega:
It's really simple, just vanilla.

Question:
What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? Do you remember?

Maria Noriega:
As it was one of my high school teachers. So I was going for like a hard time and I just felt like I had a lot of pain in my heart. And I was going to like difficult stuff. So he was talking to me and he said like he gave me an example for example, if you hit your leg or you hit your arm or whatever, like you cannot avoid the pain like if you hate yourself, you're gonna get hurt but it's your option to, it's more like a mental thing if you wanna keep that pain forever, okay, I hit my arm and it hurts for like an hour but then after you forget about it and doesn't hurt anymore. Or you can think like for a couple of weeks or months, I don't know why I hit my arm like it was so difficult, I get hurt and it it's so comfortable so like pain is like temporarily and you cannot avoid it, but like being hurt for a lot of time and like remembering that pain, physically it's over but keeping that pain in your mind or your heart, like that's optional. So it's just like, I don't know if it if someone hurts you, it's gonna hurt for a little bit then you forget about it and then you go on with your life. Or you can keep remember. Bring. Oh, I don't know why this person did this to me. Like they were so mean. So like that's only gonna affect you. Moreover, I love going to the beach.

Question:
I totally agree. That's awesome, what do you consider your happy place? Like a place that you really love.

Maria Noriega:
Like this is the first time I live by the beach in San Diego. Maybe that's one of the reasons I decided to move here so when I was living somewhere else, I will go to the facial maybe like twice a year, four times a year if I had a chance. So now that it's closer to me, I like going like once a week. If I have time, maybe just watch a show or a movie.

Question:
What's your favorite way to relax after a long day?

Question:
Do you have a TV show that you're currently watching right now that you like?

Maria Noriega:
Yes, I'm actually from albuquerking and I'm a chemist. So there's a show call breaking that, which is like a chemist from albuquergan. So there, then I finished that one, but then there's a second show that's like related, but it's not the same. It's call vertical soul. So that's the one I'm watching right now.

Question:
Cool. I've never watched that show, but I think I've heard it's good.

Maria Noriega:
It's good so I always have, it's not that I have a hard time sleeping, but after I take a shower, if I do take a shower in the, and then I like sometimes I, I mean, I sometimes I shower my hair, sometimes I don't.

Question:
What's the last thing you always do before you go to bed?

Maria Noriega:
But I usually take a shower, like to have like my body fresh and then I will watch like 10 minutes of a TV show, so I can sleep easier.

Question:
Do you find that watching TV helps you sleep?

Maria Noriega:
Yes, cuz I don't know, I think if all the lights are off and I'm just watching a show, like makes me more sleepy rather than if I just like go to bed like that without watching my phone, like TikTok or something.

Question:
Hum.

Question:
What time do you usually go to bed?

Maria Noriega:
I usually go around 10:00,30 or eleven.

Question:
What's a childhood dream that you had that you still remember?

Maria Noriega:
Sorry, what?

Question:
What's a childhood dream that you had as a kid that you still remember?

Maria Noriega:
I think I have always wanted to go to Paris since I was the kid, like I started studying French. So I always wanted to go to Paris and I just think it's a really cute city. So the, the time, the very first time I went to Paris, it was a really good memory for me.

Question:
What do your passions and dreams look like? What do you want to do when you grow up?

Maria Noriega:
Definitely. I wanna travel all around the world. Like I wanna visit every continent like I don't know if it's possible to go to every country, but the most countries possible and as a scientist, I wanna make a positive impact. It might feel like either having a product or like like finding something. Do you research? Like whatever I do when I feel like make like sorry, me like a Mark.

Question:
If you had to be a role model to other students in high school or just people in general on a certain subject or topic that, you feel like you've been through, that you can talk about, what would you choose and can you explain that?

Maria Noriega:
I think no matter no matter how good or a role model you are, people have to be passionate about that subject. Cuz I'm really passionate about science and I enjoy and I love science, but I don't think people are gonna listen to me if they're not interested in science. So I don't know maybe the things I say, they're not gonna impact as well as other people that are out actually into science. Maybe just cuz I feel a lot of people are not into science and maybe they just don't care about it. But for people that I wanna go into science fields, I would say it can get hard if it's not easy, but if that's what really if that's what you're really passionate about, you should just keep forward because sometimes you're gonna feel like you're in a, I mean I have feel that maybe I'm not like enough for that feel. I'm not like smart as others. But you, I would say you have never, you don't have to compare yourself to others cuz that like race or battle it's against yourself like you're only gonna get better and better. And you can only compare towards yourself if you compare to others people like they have different ways of study, they have different memory they have different setting skills so if you compare yourself to your peers, you're never gonna make any progress you have to compare yourselves towards this the person you were yesterday or months before. So just remember that it's like a personal raise and only focusing yourself and how good you're doing and just like you can lean and dependent others but just like they can help you study and get better together but not to compare yourself towards others.

Question:
What about being a woman in science? I feel like that's pretty cool. I feel like not a lot of girls are scientists.

Maria Noriega:
I think that was like a hard time for me doing my undergrad, because I'm, I feel like I'm a minority. There's not a lot of girls in my field, and there are not a lot of Hispanic girls, I might feel. So it was just hard for me to look up for a role model. There was usually all men. Most, I feel like I only had one female professor. They were all males, or my classmates were males. So I know we can get hard because sometimes you're looking for inspiration or just like someone you feel comfortable with, or someone you can, like, trust. And I feel guys in this field can get very competitive. And they, they always gonna, they always wanna be better than you and they're only gonna push it down. So it's hard, but just try to rely on the most girls possible, even if it's just like till the girls see you, you have to help each other out because if you didn't do, then no one else will. So it's important to stay together and help each other out.

Question:
Hum. Well, I'm trying to think like this app, like you could talk about how you feel like you're a little bit of a minority. And I'm sure other people feel that way when they're going into hard fields like maybe even engineering or science or something that's a little more male focused.

Maria Noriega:
Hum.

Question:
What advice would you give to someone that's going through what you went through in undergrad?

Maria Noriega:
I will tell them that they shouldn't listen to others. I mean, as a girl in science, I have, or we're not supposed to be starting these, or we're not supposed to work on these jobs, or we're not supposed to be in this classroom. Like there's a lot of guys that still think that way, that like science fields or math feels, computer science, coding, it's only for guys. And no, I mean, science, math, stem is for everyone. It doesn't matter like your girl or boy, like your culture, your religion, your nationality you raise. I would say sciences for everyone can enjoy it, explore it, how to be like a real scientist. Would I degree to just be interested in science. Like it's for everyone. Everyone can learn about it. And it's just something that we experience in our everyday lives so I will just tell them that don't listen to others.

Maria Noriega:
Like you belong there. You're capable of doing that. You deserve to be in the place you are because you have proven yourself and you're worth it. Like you have past six times you have pass the classes. So if you're in that classroom, if you're in that job is because you earn it.

Question:
Can you explain maybe some struggles or some challenges that you face while you were in undergrad and how you dealt with them?

Maria Noriega:
I think my biggest struggle, it was my very first semester. So I think I mean, I give this advice, but maybe I like emphasize it a lot just because I couldn't follow my personal advice when I was younger.

Maria Noriega:
I was like 18 my very first semester. So I was originally studying engineering and that was even worse because you I was basically the only girl. Like it was just like a girl and like to others, but I feel like I was the only girl that look like me. Like the other two girls there were more like masculine. So, like, I'm not saying they're not girls. I mean, I'm just saying I feel like I was like the girl that was always, like wearing dresses or like wearing pink and super, like girly. So everyone else looks like weird at me, even though the girls, because the other girls, like there, they were dressing like more masculine. So I don't know, I always feel like an easy target. So I was always like surrounded by boys. And it was hard just like seeing like there was no other one that look like me or, like I can relate to or like too, I was taking different causes and I was taking physics so I was taking the class and I was taking the laugh what are different professors? So I remember like this professor for my lab he'll I notice he was failing me on purpose like at first I was noticing that he will like greamy like really low grades and I was I don't think I'm getting all these answers wrong. Like I started asking my classmates if I can compare my test or my activities with them cuz I was getting like 2 out of ten four out of 10 and they were getting like 10 out of 10 and we literally had the same answers. So I was like what's going on? Like I don't think I deserve this grade so I want to talk to him. And I was I don't know what I'm getting this grades like if there's something I can improve or I just wanna know what I'm doing wrong so I can get better grades. And basically he told me that like he was not gonna change my grades and if I was not happy about it, I could go and talk to the dean. So that's what I did. I want to I show all my proof to the dean saying you can compare all the test, you can compare all the homeworks like I don't know why his greeting me so low and all the others are getting way better grades, and we have the same exact answers.

Maria Noriega:
Then this professor was not really happy about it because he thought that I was not gonna go and talk to Dean. So I notice how he was treating me different from others, especially cuz I was the only girl in the lab. And at first it was just, I was just like being skeptical but then I decided to gather all my evidence in case I needed to and I recorded the conversation. So I was like, you know what, I don't wanna retake this laugh cuz I feel like I'm studying, like I'm putting effort on it and I don't think I deserve to fail. And he said, well, if you don't want to fail my class, the only way you can pass is like he ask me to have, like sex in order to pass a class. And I said no. And he kept harassing me. Like he got my personal information. Like he was sex sing my personal number and everything. And I had like all the proof and I went to the dean again and I had like give the recordings and everything. And since all the engineering department was all boys, like all the professors, the deans, the head officers, like everyone was smells, no one believed me. They were like, first of all. You're 18, so you're overage, so whatever you do, it's like your own decision.

Maria Noriega:
And then the Bo, like I had the text messages, I had the boss recruitings, and they were like, well, it can be anyone else. Like we cannot see the face of the professor, so like it can be anyone else. So no one believe me. Like I thought I had enough proof to show how he was blackmailing me and harassing me, and no one did anything.

Maria Noriega:
Maybe cuz I was way younger and more immature. Like I decided to change my field, so I want to study chemistry where I found not a lot, but more girls. But just like I emphasize that advice a lot because I think I couldn't like I couldn't follow my own advice when I was younger, cuz I felt like really intimidated but like all the males in the field, no, I mean I had all my tests were like they could see my answers were right but he was still rating me wrong.

Question:
I'm sorry that happened you. That's crazy. I like. So they didn't do anything even though you had the recordings and everything?

Maria Noriega:
And I had like all the other my classmates test but we had the same answers and they were getting way better grades than me. I had the voice recordings where he said I was not gonna be able to pass a classify that I have such with him. I had like the messages where he was texting me and calling me to my personal phone number and seems they couldn't, it was not like a video or they couldn't see their face. Like they just said that like I was making it, like they said I was the one who was failing and I didn't wanna fail. So I was just like making this up so I can pass the class. And they also said since I was 18, like it was my personal choice to give my number to people, or which I never gave my personal number. Like he went to the school report records and he got my phone in my email from somewhere in the school website.

Question:
Despite undergrad, have you ever faced any other challenges?

Maria Noriega:
Well, I think that was the hardest. Then I feel like it got a little bit easier when I changed to chemistry just because I, there were more girls and it was more, it was more even. It was not its engineering still, I think it's always hard not finding like someone you can relate to in this type of field, because it's like an intersection, like being Hispanic woman in staff, so people are always like, you're always gonna see how males get all the benefits and girls have to work harder. So it's not like a vague event that happened to me, like the very first one, but it's just like a small things every day. Like there were a lot of seminars and sometimes we had guest speakers. So there were male scientists that will go and give a talk to others, and you can see how all the other scientists, like, they respected them and they were, like, really proud and applauding and everything. And then when you had a female speaker, all the males were trying to, like, push her down. Like, you could see it's really visible how everyone in the field treat women different. And they try to make them less, like, they treat them as if they were not smart enough or they were not prepared enough, even when they're sometimes even more than other guys. So it's something that you get treated like that or you can see how other girls get treated like that. And I feel like not everyone, but most of the guys are always trying to push girls down and make them feel like they're not supposed to be there, and that's not their field.

Question:
I feel that. I feel like it's hard being a girl sometimes but is there something that you are proud of accomplishing?

Maria Noriega:
I felt like really part of me when I graduated three months ago, just because since most of your professors, it's not like they tell you like writing your face that you're not gonna make it, but like I feel some professors make it way harder than they should. For example, I had, when I was taking, I think it was like cirquit physics, it was way later on of my degree, it was more advanced physics. So I remember a friend of mine, she got Covid. She was a girl. So her name was Bianca. She got Covid and she couldn't take one of the test. So I mean, she was literally in the hospital like she was really bad because she has ads now. So she spent like a week in the hospital and she had the medical bills and all the proof. And she was like, sorry, professor, I don't know if I can take the test any other time like I was in the hospital. And he's they're no, like, I mean it's not her fault like she didn't decided to get Covid. And he said, no, like she missed the test. And I mean she was able to pass a class, but she thought she was thinking about dropping the class because she thought she was not gonna make it. I mean, of course she didn't good. She didn't do really well as she could have if she had the opportunity to take test, but she still has a cost. And then there was another time where in the semester my grandma died, so I had to go, well, I was living in Albuquerque, but my grandma was, it's not there. So I had to travel to the funeral and be with my family. So it was also like a family, not excuse, but like a family issue. So I talk to the professor as well saying, I'm sorry I think I'm gonna miss the test because my fam, my grandma die so I have to travel to be with my family. And he also said no, I'm sorry, I cannot do anything about it. Also miss a test, but then I will see some of the guys. They were like first. I don't know exactly the reason, but like sometimes they didn't show up to the test. I mean I don't know if it was like a family emergency or a health related emergency like me and my friend friend, but why? I think like me and my friend we had a belly reason to have a makeup test. Why would you tell us? No, but then I don't know what else it's I don't know what else can be a worth a reason to miss a test and have a makeup that your grandma dying or you having Covid.

Maria Noriega:
So I don't know why he said es to this other guys, but not to us. So there were some professors made it really hard for us, especially the girls when I feel like if you're a professor, you should be passionate about teaching and like sharing your knowledge to your students. So some of them make it a little bit harder for you then what you already is just like graduating was like I was really part of myself because I also remember my mom when she was doing her undergrad. She wanted to do engineering. So when she was in high school, she wanted to do engineering and the college advisor told her, I don't know if you should do engineering because that's not for girls.

Question:
Hum.

Maria Noriega:
Like you should go for marketing or business or finance, like something where you can find more girls. So that was probably like, I don't know, she's 50 now, like 30 something years ago. And if that happened to my mom and it's still happening right now, like 30 years after, like, I mean, it's sad that's still happening that there's still people with like promoting matches them. But I'm just happy that I was able to overcome all those things and being able to get my degree and get a job, and get into grad school.

Question:
What kind of science do you want to specialize in?

Maria Noriega:
So I did chemistry for my undergrad, and I'm doing health science right now. So the thing I wanna do, I wanna have my own products. Like, as a chemist, I wanna have my own line of products of skincare and sunscreen. So I would say it's like pharmaceutical chemistry, yes.

Question:
Pharmaceutical. That's cool so you're passionate kind of about science and healthcare. Sort of cool do you, DRA, do you enjoy traveling alone or would you rather be with people.

Maria Noriega:
Yes, with people. I have never travel alone.

Question:
What's a place you've always wanted to live?

Maria Noriega:
I would say friends.

Question:
France.

Maria Noriega:
Yes. Just like, I don't know. I mean, the times I've been there, like, the food is really good. And I feel people, like, here, they're always worried about something, about school or like their job or like, I don't know, like they're always in a rush or they always have to be doing something or like they care a lot about people's approval. Or I don't know, being good at school, being good at your job, which I'm, I know it's important, but I feel like your friends, like or in Europe in general, people just care more about being happy. Like their goal is to be happy and have like a good time, travel, like have fun I don't know. I feel like there is much more in life than just like studying and working. You should always be able to have fun and and just like spend time with friends and family and just be happy.

Question:
What school did you go to again?

Maria Noriega:
It's UNM, the university of New Mexico, at SDSA.

Question:
And then you're getting your masters now, right? Where is that? Cool. I got SCSU.

Maria Noriega:
You go.

Question:
I go there right now.

Maria Noriega:
You went. Okay.

Question:
Do you have a favorite way you like to study?

Maria Noriega:
I think I'm really a visual so whenever there's the professor is giving the class and they're like making graphs or drawings, I like to read and do drawings of the things I understand are also like watching videos, like those videos on YouTube that have like little like drawings about, I mean, they're explaining the topic, but they're showing something on the screen. So not only like reading it, but whenever I see how the things work visually, I will say like, like videos or like watching like the the like the board where people are like riding or making the figures, the graphics.

Question:
Do you? What's your favorite thing to do in San Diego for fun?

Maria Noriega:
I like going to gym and like working out, but I feel like you can do that anywhere else. But I will say just going for walks at the beach, I usually go to either LA Hoya or Mission Bay, Miss Mission Beach, sorry I go to church and like the church groups.

Question:
Which beaches?

Question:
Do you have any other hobbies outside of going on walks in the gym? Like anything you're a part of, like activities or clubs are, which shirts you go to?

Maria Noriega:
So I it's weird cuz I go to a Catholic church that my neighbor show me. So I started going really recently just because I mean, I was going to one of key so I was just trying like different ones and then I started going to this when my neighbor, which is really close to where I live.

Question:
You.

Maria Noriega:
But then I feel like on campuses more like cushion groups. So I I'm catalog I'm not Christian, but I give it a try and and I like the way to do things like I feel they're more like dynamic like their services, like we call it mass, but they call it services so I feel like it's more dynamic and it's more like a group therapy, I would say I don't know like everyone talks and give their opinion. So I think that's really fun. There's like a group called compass which I've been going to like their meetings. So I enjoy that.

Question:
What's the group called?

Maria Noriega:
Oh, it's called compass.

Question:
Oh, come. I've heard of that, actually, what's a topic that you feel like you could talk about for hours?

Maria Noriega:
I felt there was like promoting themselves on campus.

Maria Noriega:
I'm just like you're really passionate about science so like anything science related, I think my favorite topic would be like conservation biology, so all like the biodiversity, the types of like animals, the species extinctions, either that or I also like fashion, like floating or like fashion, not only like shopping but like fashion trends or like fashion history.

Question:
That's awesome. The last question is, if you could give advice to anyone or quote your favorite quote or something that you would want the world to know, what would you say?

Maria Noriega:
I would say like one advice I could give to anyone is that. Your happiness depends on yourself. Like I just wish people didn't compare themselves to others because if you're always trying to look to the person next to you, everyone's different and everyone has their own spark. So maybe you could be really good at something and bad at. I mean you cannot be perfect. So we all have our flaws, but we also have things that we're good at. So you should be proud of the things you're good at. And if there are things that you wanna get better at, focus in it and get better for yourself just to prove that you're capable of doing it for yourself. But never compare your part, your progress or your abilities or your capacities to anyone else, because everyone else has, like, their own struggles and their own history and their own methods of buying work, their work. So your happiness and how good you are, like, that's only something that you can compare to yourself. So whenever, like, try to say, oh, why they have this or why they accomplish this or why they're like this. And I'm not like that. Because if you keep your life comparing to others, like, you would never appreciate the things you have or like your skills or whatever you're doing or whatever you're good at.

Question:
Awesome, I love that. Well, that's it for today's session. I feel like I really got to know you and we're gonna give that data to our boss and if I need more from you, I'll just send you an email and I'll get you get you on here again but thank you for join. Morning.
