问答对
Question:
Okay. Is that your new room?

Alexa Caramazza:
My roommate cat threw up on my bed, so she's in shambles at the moment, but it's okay.

Question:
Oh, no.

Alexa Caramazza:
But this is my room. She's a little small. In my closet is like my desk is in my closet because I don't really have anywhere else to put it, because that dresser didn't fit in this little space. So I have it kind of like a little DOC. I'll show you. There's like my jewelry in my mirror and then my little desk.

Question:
Thank you. How's Water, Girl?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's good. I am still loving everyone. The new girl, Malias, doing good. I definitely think we need more people, but we always need more people. I feel like, if I'm not at watergrow, which definitely isn't really my favorite way to spend my weekend, but I would say my favorite way to spend my weekend is probably, if it's warm enough, going to the beach with my friends.

Question:
Okay, so these the questions I gave me to ask you what is your favorite way to spend a weekend if you're not a watergirl?

Alexa Caramazza:
I feel like drives are always really fun, like on the weight of the beach and like back from the beach, it's always lively and like everyone's listen music and just having fun. But then afterwards, probably going to like farmers markets. The Ocean Beach Farmers Market is my favorite. But I also been to other farmers markets that I love, I, every Sunday, actually, I have family dinner with my parents. And since I've been working so much, I have like family breakfast, lunch or dinner, depending on what time I'm off. But I always make in time for that just because when I wasn't working at Watergirl, it was convenient for me to always have Sundays with them. So I would just spend the whole day at their house. We always watch a movie. We always watch Moana, honestly I know it's so cute, but I'm like just spending time with my family and my pets that live there.

Question:
I'm he's good.

Alexa Caramazza:
But that's probably like the highlight always of my weekend, I would say.

Question:
Love that. Moana's so good for no reason. Like the message is so good. I love.

Alexa Caramazza:
No, it's so good and it's so cute cuz like, my dad is Hawaiian and I'm Hawaiian, so it's just like the vibes are just there and I just love it.

Question:
Okay. What's your all time favorite movie and why?

Alexa Caramazza:
Another Disney movie Princess and the frog has always been one of my favorite movies. And I don't know if it's just because it's, like, the cute little fairy tale, but it also has mixed in humor with a lot of good context that kind of relates to me. I guess Tiana is always working, always, like, fighting for what she wants and, like, kicking herself if she doesn't get it.

Question:
Right.

Alexa Caramazza:
But I feel like that really correlates to me because I'm constantly working to put myself through school and, like, paying my own rent and pay my own bills. So it's like, I guess it kind of has always been fitting for me because I work two jobs in high school, too but I just love that movie. And it's really funny, too.

Question:
I didn't know you work two jobs in high school. That's a lot.

Alexa Caramazza:
I was a nanny for, I was an overnight nanny for two infant kids who were also special needs.

Question:
Oh, gosh.

Alexa Caramazza:
They were, it was rough for, I loved them. They were amazing. But their parents worked graveyard shifts. So I was there overnight nanny. And they were like family friends, too, but they were coke and  babies from the system that they adopted.

Question:
My gosh.

Alexa Caramazza:
So it's crazy. But then I just worked at a little cafe on the weekends, too.

Question:
Okay. Wow, that's awesome. I did not know that. What's your favorite childhood memory, if you have one?

Alexa Caramazza:
Be your child memory.

Alexa Caramazza:
I think this one's kind of funny, but my family, we've always been really into camping. And we all had quads, and I had a mini pink quad, but there was something wrong with it.

Question:
because oh 1��

Alexa Caramazza:
I think the throttle would get stuck. Like the throttle would get stuck down, so I would be stuck driving. And the first time I drove it, it's probably for this reason that it's broken, but I rolled it down the cul, the sack. We lived on a cold sack, and it was like slightly on a hill. I'm just not the best driver with those kinds of things, I guess. Well, I wasn't when I was younger, but I rolled it down the cul to sack, and it was on my birthday. And it was like before I was supposed to go to like the gymnastics place for my birthday party. And like I was all scraped up. I was bruised. But it was just so funny. I was laughing so hard and it was just really funny. And like all my family was there and like some family that I like really never get to see except on special occasions but it, was just an eventful time.

Question:
Do you enjoy cooking or do you prefer eating out and why?

Alexa Caramazza:
Lately, I've been a lot better about cooking and like meal prepping. But eating out is a guilty pleasure. I am.

Question:
I will be out.

Alexa Caramazza:
I love going out because like my friends and I always go out and we try and try little, like small businesses. And there was this one place called Lata Verna. It was in like Hillcrest area and my friends and I went there like probably every month last year. And we would always go for somebody's birthday. But at that point I had seven roommates, so we were all going and they were always so accommodating and we just loved going out to eat there. So they would always pamper us and give us free, like little canolis and other things and it was just like super sweet. But I feel like going out to eat is always very fun cuz you get to talk to everyone.

Question:
Oh, that took you. I love that. I wish I had a little place me and my friends go and they knew us. Oh, definitely.

Alexa Caramazza:
I know you just try and find them. Cuz I feel like little businesses like that are definitely great for family kind of time with your roommates.

Question:
I feel like cafe coyotes are like. But that's so like, I know.

Alexa Caramazza:
I love Cafe Coyote. Cafe Corey is so good.

Question:
So good. Let's see, what's a place you've always wanted to visit and why?

Alexa Caramazza:
I've always wanted to visit Samoa because that's where my family roots from. Cuz I feel like I'm so distant, cuz I grew up in the States that I never really got to learn a lot about my culture. And I feel like a lot of like Hawaiian and Samoan and Tong and culture is really, like suppressed and hidden because like white culture is kind of just taken over. So it's kind of hard for us to learn about it when we're so far away from it. But I've always wanted to get a traditional tribal hand, like with the pick and the ink tattoo.

Question:
Oh, you should.

Alexa Caramazza:
And I think my dad really wants one of those, too, so I'm gonna try and look into getting one of those as like a family tattoo.

Question:
Honestly, like, traveling is amazing. Like, when I went to Europe this summer, I Learned so much about myself and, like, it's great, like.

Alexa Caramazza:
I think I'm gonna try my best to study, abroad this upcoming summer. If all goes well with myself financially, I'm gonna hopefully be able to like pay my way to study abroad, which sounds so rough, but I really want to do it while I'm still in college. So I think I'm gonna try and go to Naples, Italy. So I feel like that would be like a good access point for cuz I really wanna be near the water, but I feel like that'd be a good place to be where I can still access other places.

Question:
If you go on the Aztec abroad database, they have a ton of scholarships. And I applied to all of them and I got a ton of money. So you could do that.

Alexa Caramazza:
Really? Oh, I need to do that cuz I did the general scholarship application.

Question:
Okay.

Alexa Caramazza:
Do they have one for specifically for study abroad? I need to do that. I will do that literally after this conversation, that would be amazing.

Question:
It I didn't like it a ton of money because I didn't applied all of them. I applied pretty late. But if you get ahead of it, I'm sure you could get money cuz my friend Katie went to Germany for free. Like she got everything paid for cuz she applied to a bunch of them. So if you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?

Alexa Caramazza:
Oh my God, that'd be so nice. Cuz then I get pay off my student loans. That would be so nice. Oh my gosh.

Alexa Caramazza:
I feel like flying is such a basic answer, but I feel then like it would be so convenient. Like I could go anywhere in the world just by fine. And I feel like that would be super fun. But then I also would like to explore underwater. So being able to swim just for hours and hours without having it come up and take a breath. But I'm also kind of scared of what's like not known in the ocean. So I don't know if I would actually wanna do that, actually so that I could escape really quick.

Question:
So maybe teleportation if you get, you just teleport away?

Alexa Caramazza:
That's smart. That's like the perfect medium.

Question:
I think mine would be teleportation cuz I could literally just, if I was late to class, just teleport there. Like I wouldn't even have to fly. I would just be there.

Alexa Caramazza:
That'd be so nice, actually. You're so right. That's really good. I think so nice.

Question:
What's your favorite type of music?

Alexa Caramazza:
I'd say my favorite type of music easily is RMB says. That is like my favorite artist, but I also like Summer Walker and like Jay Cole. But a lot of that music just like is very soul fulfilling, I feel like. And it's not like heavy rap, but it's very relatable and, like, kind of feeds to, like, how my life feels right now. And it's, like, gives you all these different options of, like, how you want to feel. Some of it's, like, soulful, like, good music. Some of it's a little sad. Some of it's, like, happy. But I love camping.

Question:
Definitely love that oh, try to see. Do you enjoy outdoor activities like hiking or camping? Are you more of an indoor girl?

Alexa Caramazza:
I grew up camping a lot because I'm from Tahoe. So in Tahoe, there's tons of really cool places to camp. And there's this one place called Ice House Reservoir. And that's when my family always went every summer for camping. And we probably went, like, four to five times a summer. But we would camp and just, like, we had a huge group of people that we would go with. And some would be intense, some would be in RVs. But it always was like the best time because there was the lake, but then there's also like hiking areas and there's this actually really big camp for kids that was there. And we did like a tour for it, but it was really expensive. But even just like getting to see it, they had like the huge like rope things up in the trees that you could, like climb on and it was really cool. But I love the outdoors. It's very people.

Question:
I love that. I wish I went camping more. I just like remember being a child and like going camping one time and there was, we were like eating and then we all went to our tents and we left all our food out. And they were like, I wanna say like deer or like cows or like some animal just came and just eat all of our food.

Alexa Caramazza:
Oh it's definitely a challenge.

Question:
And we were all terrified. And I just remember being like I know I want, I need to do that more.

Alexa Caramazza:
There's a lot of things that come with it that you have to be super careful about, especially food. But once you really get in the hang of things, it's really fun. You should try it more. There's a bunch of camping spots along the ocean, too, down here.

Question:
I do. Let me see. What's your go to? Comfort food.

Alexa Caramazza:
Mac and cheese.

Question:
What kind?

Alexa Caramazza:
Mac and cheese is like, I don't know what it is during like this semester when I'm really like in the rut of things. When school's really hard, I'm working too much. Trader Joe's Mac and cheese is so good. But then also my mom makes really good homemade Mac and cheese, but also like check in luggage.

Question:
Yes, I love Mac and cheese. Oh, the water roll back is good.

Alexa Caramazza:
It's so good.

Question:
I love the water draw packages.

Alexa Caramazza:
It is really good. Do you like the kids version or like the adult version more?

Question:
There's the diff. There's two different versions.

Alexa Caramazza:
So. The kids version doesn't have the seared hard, harder cheese on top. You know what I mean? Like it's just like the noodles. It doesn't have the layer of cheese on top that has like the little golden part.

Question:
I like that, though. I the. I like the adult one.

Alexa Caramazza:
I do too. Some people don't like it. I think it's so good.

Question:
I just like cheese use.

Alexa Caramazza:
Me too. Oh, my gosh.

Question:
Okay. Why don't I feel like this is like speed dating? I'm like, this is funny.

Alexa Caramazza:
No, it feels like it's really funny. It's like, wow, we're getting along so well right now. Question:.

Question:
Let me think. These are just. No, that's too boring. Okay. What's a hobby you've always wanted to try?

Alexa Caramazza:
That's a good question. I really want to get into surfing. I don't know if that counts, but I've tried it. So I don't know if that counts because I've tried it, but I really want to get back into it. I did it, well, I was traveling in Hawaii, but I didn't like really get into it in San Diego. Now that I'm here, all my roommates have surfboard, so I'm gonna try and get one, I think. But I really want to be good at it cuz I see people like shredding and it's so cool. Cuz I cannot do that. Like I can wake surf like behind a boat.

Question:
You see this scare me I said the Sandy could be just scare me cuz all of the stingrays and sharks that have. Oh, I'm like no, it doesn't even work.

Alexa Caramazza:
You have to shuffle your feet to avoid them. But, really, okay, I.

Question:
That's like a it doesn't work. My dad was stingray shuffled his whole life and still gotten stung by stingrays. It works like 50% of the time.

Alexa Caramazza:
If it's meant to be and I get stung, it'll happen. It's okay.

Question:
Don't pee on it. Everyone says to do that but don't hot water, don't know, I know no or the jellyfish thing like don't be on it.

Alexa Caramazza:
No, I don't know who came up with that, but that's a horrible myth. But that's literally so evil, right?

Question:
Like that's not gonna help.

Alexa Caramazza:
Why would that be your first instinct? There is so much bacteria. Why would you do that?

Question:
Literally. Let's see, do you have a favorite season?

Alexa Caramazza:
I feel like my favorite season is right between spring and summer, because it's not, like, too hot, but the flowers are still really blooming and there's, like, butterflies everywhere and everyone's just like kind of getting out of the rut from winter still. So everyone's kind of in a happier mood now that it's, like, sunny again. And I feel like it's always just, like, a happy time and all the flower fields bloom and I really want to go to the Carlsbad Flower Field. But recently my roommates and I went to to 1 into levista and it was so pretty.

Question:
Oh, I've been to the Carl's Bad Ones and they're so cool.

Alexa Caramazza:
I know. I see them when I pass by sometimes, like when I'm driving that way occasionally, they'll all be bloomed. But then I've never been how much you have to pay to get in.

Question:
God, I don't remember. It was in high school when I went with my friend Katie and I think it was like $20 or like $15.

Alexa Caramazza:
I, that's crazy.

Question:
But this was like years ago. So I don't, everything is cost so much money now, I don't even wanna think about it.

Alexa Caramazza:
I know. To walk in a flower field, you have to pay $25,$20.

Question:
I don't know oh, if you could meet any historical figure or any person, like famous person, who would be and why?

Alexa Caramazza:
It really sucks.

Alexa Caramazza:
Like anyone, they can be alive or like far back. I feel like I would really want to meet Obama. I feel like he's like a very admirable person and he just has a very good outlook on life. So I feel like he'd be a good person to me and get to know kind of, but also hear about and get some insight from about his life, but also how should, how I should pursue mine.

Question:
What would be the first thing you ask him?

Alexa Caramazza:
I think I would ask him if he was still in college, what he would do differently and what he would make sure he would do.

Question:
It's a good question. I think I would ask him like how it felt like that moment when he got the presidency is like the first black man to ever be a president. Like I think I was asking that.

Alexa Caramazza:
That's a good question, too. I feel like that's so personal and I feel like that moment was so surreal. Probably, I have recently had to become a morning person because I have an ATM class.

Question:
Definitely like a really cool moment. Let me see, are you a morning routine person and is your morning routine look like if you have one?

Alexa Caramazza:
So I've start before school started, I started getting kind of into the routine of waking up early. So I was practicing waking up at least at 8 a m. To go to the gym or do something productive. But now that schools started, I will typically wake up, I'll make my bed, brush my teeth, get all kind of ready. And then I'll typically have an extra 15,20 minutes to do something else. So like this morning I started laundry. So then when I come back from my class, it'll be all done and I can throw it in the dryer, which I did when I got home. But I went to class after that and class was really good. We just did like a tiny quiz just about APA. Formatting is really easy, but.

Question:
What class?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's for. Com 300. So I guess for com mages, we have to learn APA. And I'm not looking forward to it. But it's fine. He made it super easy. So I'm hoping his grading on essays won't be super harsh considering how he only taught us like 5 different things. But hopefully that'll go well. But then after class and our little quiz, I went to the gym. And that's typically something that I'll do after my 8:00am class. And then I'll come home em kind of do other productive things throughout the day. Maybe take a nap if I'm really tired.

Question:
Real.

Alexa Caramazza:
But then I also have another asset, 3:30 I kind of have a big gap between. So I'll do some homework and other things and then go to class. But my morning routine has definitely changed since I started going to school again. But I really like waking up early now. I feel like I get so much more done in the day instead of waking up super late and not really having the motivation to do anything.

Question:
And I think once you start getting up early and you start, it's not as hard anymore.

Alexa Caramazza:
Exactly. I like today, it was so much easier for me to wake up than I think it's ever been, because I've really been in the process of things and getting used to it.

Question:
But with those night shifts at watergirly, are you working during the week? Like, what days do you work at night?

Alexa Caramazza:
So last night I got off at 10. I was closing last night, but I have classes only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which is really nice right now. And then two of my other classes are all online. So I'm working. I'm available to work Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, but I'm only working 3, max 4 days a week because I really wanna, like, be good in school and not stressed. But everything's been fine with working, and she's been very accommodating and she's trying to work with everyone.

Question:
Just so you told Jackie. So you told Jackie, I can only work 3 to 4 times a week.

Alexa Caramazza:
We haven't been super busy right now either. Last night, it was slow enough for Lexie and I to be there, but then Lexie ended up going home at maybe 7:00 and then we only had five other walk ins after that for three hours.

Question:
We. No, I don't know. I miss it, but I also love my new job. Like I, I could say like I've been taking over the interviews that you experienced cuz I'm basically taking Josh's position.

Alexa Caramazza:
I think that is very fitting for you right now.

Question:
So the guy that interviewed you he is just like resigned cuz he got a new job. So I'm taking over his position, which is like crazy because I like just started, but I'm like taking over everything right now and I'm really stressed cuz I'm only part time.

Alexa Caramazza:
Oh, good for you.

Question:
I'm in school. But so I'm going to like meetings and conferences and like doing this and like taking over a lot. So thank you.

Alexa Caramazza:
That's really cool. I'm really you, definitely stressful.

Question:
I have just been so busy. I'm just like help.

Alexa Caramazza:
Are you still only working at all days a week?

Question:
So I work like 29 hours a week, but I get to work 10 hours from home. So it's nice. Like I'm here Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. So Tuesdays I'm from twelve, or no, sorry, 9:00 to twelve cuz I have class. And then Wednesdays I work from home.

Question:
Mondays I work from home. And then Thursdays I work 9 to 3. So I'll be here till 3 today. And then Fridays I work 12 to 5, Saturdays 12 to 5 and then I'm off Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays pretty much.

Alexa Caramazza:
It's a pretty good schedule, especially with school. I but it is overwhelming working more than 20 hours, I feel like. But I hope it's manageable for you and I hope you're liking it.

Question:
It's definitely I, oh, I know I'll try to visit.

Alexa Caramazza:
We miss you.

Question:
I just, I like went in there and I was like, oh my God, I'm so uncomfortable cuz I was in like my whole rave outfit and I was like, they, my friends made me take a tequila shooter, like outside my work, like on my knees. And I was like, guys, like, my friends are crazy, but I just start 21 and like going out with them has been so fun. Like, I love it. But, oh, but that's true.

Alexa Caramazza:
I know. I'm so Jeff. All of my roommates but beside one right now are 21. And then the one that's not 2021 yet, she turns 21 in literally a month. It's like September 17th. I think she's so much closer than I am. So there's gonna months between where I turn 21, so I won't be able to really go out with them. But I'm going to start probably working a little bit more then just to kind of distract myself from the fact that I'm missing out, but also just to save up for when I do get to go out with them.

Question:
Oh, okay. These are such weird questions.

Alexa Caramazza:
But, that's hard because I grew up in the mountains by a lake.

Question:
Are you a beach person or a mountain person?

Alexa Caramazza:
So I feel like that's a very complex question. Like in Tahoe, I feel like it's very in between. For me, I would say a beach person, but I'm more of a lake person. The ocean isn't my favorite. I love ocean, but not necessarily to swim in unless there's like a reef. But for Tahoe, it's very comfortable for me and like I know the water, I know the lake, I know how it works. So growing up there kind of made me s more susceptible to liking and being more comfortable around lakes. But features are probably the best answer.

Question:
I would say I'm a beach person, but I love mountains. I love like lookouts and sense. Do you have a favorite quote?

Alexa Caramazza:
Best lookout spot.

Question:
In Tahoe and now my friend Kendall went to, she lived in Roseville or something in near Tahoe, like back.

Alexa Caramazza:
There's the best lookout swaps.

Alexa Caramazza:
Oh it makes it.

Question:
And she's always like, I bring my Jeep to this place and it's so pretty. And I'm oh, like, that sounds fun.

Alexa Caramazza:
My favorite quote though is probably love all you see, including yourself. So I feel like it's very communal and it kind of brings people to you, like loving everything. Including what? You see in yourself besides things that you don't like.

Question:
I like that. I've never heard that, actually. And I like I'm a quote, early die.

Alexa Caramazza:
Really that would, it, I use it for, I look for quotes for a really long time. When like an assignment ask you to put your favorite quote, I always like look at them for a really long time. But I never really find any of that aren't super cheesy unless it's a rare occasion. But I feel like that one's really cute. At the same time.

Question:
I like that. What's a goal you're currently working towards right now?

Alexa Caramazza:
Right now I am currently working towards moving up in watergrill. I'm actually hoping to kind of do what Gabby did when I turned 21, which is go into the event coordinator position as an assistant because I have history in event coordinating and I feel like it would be a very good fit for me. And then it would also help me grow in their business instead of just saying a hostess. Because I don't really want to be a food runner, I don't think. But I would like a more career base position instead of working as like the front of house. But I feel like that would be option for me because I my last job was in event staffing. So I feel like it correlates really well.

Question:
What do you wanna do with your majored.

Alexa Caramazza:
With my major. I actually wanna go into human resources. So with communication, I was able or I'm gonna be able to also get my HR certificate through SCSU. I'll probably do that a couple years, maybe a year after I graduate, just because it'll probably take me about a year to receive the certificate anyways, but I'm looking at going into human resources, and I actually have some connections with, like, Petco for their human resources department. So I'm hoping that a good position will open up for an HR Assistant where I can eventually move up to an associate or a manager position.

Question:
That'd be cool. I always wanted, like, I've always had a thing for HR, but I don't know, I'm such a personable human. Like, I need to, like, I don't know, like, conflict is not like my thing. Like, I would be able to be the middleman. I.

Alexa Caramazza:
Conflict hasn't been my thing for a long time, but eventually, like, all of my communication classes really started kicking in, I feel like. And I've definitely gotten better about talking about my feelings, especially with other people, or how I feel about certain things.

Question:
Are you a planner or are you more spontaneous?

Alexa Caramazza:
I am a planner. I cannot do anything without having a plan. I think I definitely get it for my mom she is a planner but I I don't have it with me right now, but I have all my assignments for this week and like next week all written out so I like the little checkboxes so I can check it off but I definitely plan farther ahead just so I can anxiously be prepared for it and I kind of overthink a lot of, things but I plan everything I think, my God, I love that's gonna be me when I get in more career base.

Question:
Let me two girl, but like, I have 4 planners, 4 for different things, like one fitness planner, once my triple V planner, like this has all of my meetings and stuff coming up in it. And then this, this is my week planner for school.

Alexa Caramazza:
I feel like I'm gonna have everything super organized cuz it stresses me out a otherwise.

Question:
And this one's, it's got, it's just from target and it has a bunch of little strawberries on it.

Alexa Caramazza:
Oh, I like that. Get that one.

Question:
I love it. And it gives you the month.

Alexa Caramazza:
That's so cute, I relate.

Question:
And then it also, I can like, so for September, I'm taking time off for work. So I have, like, I'm going to Vegas and then I'm going to cross. So like, those are my approved time off. And then I have, like, in a meeting with Advancing Students Forward. That's a lot. That's just September, but like this month's been crazy I probably could.

Alexa Caramazza:
I have two planners. Right now, but I need another one, food prep ideas and my fitness journal so that I can log what I did and remember each workout that I did.

Question:
I can't work out anymore. I just physically, like, I've been working out for so long and I just need a break. Like, I can't. But I know if I stop, I'm just gonna lose all.

Alexa Caramazza:
Sometimes we need a break, especially you're doing a lot going like you have a lot going on, I feel like you need a break.

Question:
What's the best piece of advice you've ever received and from who?

Alexa Caramazza:
Feel like any advice that I received from my mom is very helpful for me I would say the best piece of ice she really taught me growing up is to not let really what others think about you affect you. Especially cuz I'm very an overthinking and I stress about whether or not people like me or if people hate me. But I think it's helped me a lot to grow from that needing of everyone to like me. And it kind of taught me that it's okay for people to have different opinions. It's okay for people to not get along and what who's in your life is going to stay if they want to be there.

Question:
Awesome what is a place you consider your happy place?

Alexa Caramazza:
My parents house, my parents house is definitely my happy place. Just the energy is so different there. When I need anything, I know they can help me out. And on bad days or sometimes like before classes, I'll go and just hang out there and do some homework there. Just I feel so safe and comfortable and I don't have to explain myself.

Question:
Hum.

Alexa Caramazza:
I don't have to be stressed because a lot of the weight is lifted off my shoulders cuz the comfort is there already. And my pets are there too. My childhood dog and my childhood cat who is seventeen. He's so old, but he's still there.

Question:
My God said, oh my God.

Alexa Caramazza:
And, so old.

Question:
Seventeen is that?

Alexa Caramazza:
Literally, we got him. I was three.

Question:
How old is that in dog years, like it's 7 years, right?

Alexa Caramazza:
I don't know actually, cuz I can't remember what a dog gear is it. My gosh, I need to look this up. I need to know.

Question:
I'm gonna do it.

Alexa Caramazza:
Let's, my gosh, wait, this thing says carriers.

Question:
118 August, I think.

Alexa Caramazza:
If in human years, a cat year is 15, but then it doesn't make sense. It says two years is 24 years old.

Question:
What about a DOC?

Alexa Caramazza:
Let me see. SO15. Oh, for dogs, I'm not sure, 15.

Question:
Oh, you're Cat. Seventeen.

Alexa Caramazza:
My cat, seventeen.

Question:
How old your dog?

Alexa Caramazza:
He is nine, but he does not act like he's 9. He is such a baby. He's so cute.

Question:
Oh, let's see. What's a TV show you're currently watching?

Alexa Caramazza:
I am honestly the worst, worst person at watching TV shows. I don't know why I can never stick with them. Just cuz I always have such a weird schedule going on with work. I and I also lost my TV remotes, but I found them this morning. So I haven't been able to watch TV. But one of my favorite TV shows is friends. Friends is always like just a very good comfort, easy laugh show and it kind of like the years that we're in right now, especially in the beginning, they're like living on their own for the first time, some of them, they're kind of figuring everything out. Dating is a mess, but it's always interesting.

Question:
Literally. What's the last thing you do before going to bed?

Alexa Caramazza:
The lastly I do before going to bed, usually I'll kind of just lay there and kind of do a replay in my head of my day and try and see whether or not I need to do something tomorrow, kind of pre plan for my day tomorrow I'll usually check things off in my planner, sometimes watch TikTok's guilty pleasure. But if I am feeling it watching movie before bed.

Question:
What's, what are your top 3 movies, do you think?

Alexa Caramazza:
Top three, man on fire is definitely a really good movie. Princess of the frog, like I said earlier, but I don't know if you've ever seen man on fire.

Question:
Okay, I have it.

Alexa Caramazza:
Really good. Sorry, my roommate's cat isn't here.

Question:
Okay.

Alexa Caramazza:
But it's a third. I'm trying to think, probably this movie called Blue Crush. It's it's a surfing movie. My family always watched it when I was growing up.

Question:
Heard of it. I've heard of that. I think isn't it's a movie.

Alexa Caramazza:
It's really, it's like the two thought, right? So it's pretty old, but it's really good. It's a movie.

Question:
Did you see the Barbie movie?

Alexa Caramazza:
I didn't, I'm so sadly into the Barbie movie. I don't know if it's still in theaters.

Question:
What?

Alexa Caramazza:
I went and watched The Sound of freedom instead when I went to movies.

Question:
I heard you talking about cuz they weren't like putting it on any platforms, right? Like they weren't putting it on.

Alexa Caramazza:
I don't think they're, unless they've made some major different decisions since. But it was really sad. Honestly, actually, that's one of my top movies now. I lied because it's so good.

Question:
I wanna see it. What's it about again?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's about child trafficking and this cop who kind of is sick of catching the creeps that do it and like, partaking like child pornography and those types of things, but not rescuing any of the children. Like he was so tired of finding these people that are doing it, but not finding any of the kids. So he kind of goes on this Tangent of searching and searching for children. And it's so sad though. Oh my gosh, room and that really tell a story.

Question:
Oh I love movies that, that are real like that, like I forgot what it was called, but it was a TV series on Netflix and it was like about these like five black kids that were in a park, and there was like a, a murder and they got charge for the murder and this guy lost 20 years of his life. And then it came to be that they found the evidence of the actual guy that killed him. And then they, the guy got freed out of jail and it was this whole thing and they all got like $5 million each, because they lost.

Alexa Caramazza:
That's create.

Question:
But it was a good series.

Alexa Caramazza:
But I mean $5 million is not enough. What I feel like that's a lot, but like to go through so much traumatic things within 20 years is not worth that amount in my opinion.

Question:
I don't.

Alexa Caramazza:
But, for me, I prefer smaller social gatherings.

Question:
Definitely not. Are you, do you like going to parties or social gatherings?

Alexa Caramazza:
It can still be kind of a party environment, but I really do prefer for having just all my friends at my house or going to somebody else's house and having a bonfire, or hanging out of the pool or doing other smaller group kind of things where I can still talk to everybody. And it's not just like drinking and binge drinking just for no purpose. But I feel like everyone and a smaller environment has a more close relationship with everyone there. In a party setting, you don't really get to know everyone for who they really are. And I think it's really important to have good friends that you can really hang out with without it being a party scene, too, for all. My friends, we always do little kickmarks at our house and we actually just got an inflatable pool for our backyard. And it's really cute. But we also got a fire pit, too. So we had a bunch of people over.

Question:
Oh, I love that.

Alexa Caramazza:
And you just have smaller gatherings to kind of catch up and get to know people more, but it is, it definitely changes as you kind of go through different phases in your life.

Question:
I like the same way. But now that I can go to bars, it's like a whole different vibe. If.

Alexa Caramazza:
Like you'll go through the 21 phase for a little bit and then you'll probably go back.

Question:
Definitely. Okay what's your favorite type of weather?

Alexa Caramazza:
My favorite weather, I love the rain. I definitely love the rain, but I hate when it's raining for too long. So I do love sunny days where it's sunny and probably 75 degrees where it's super comfortable temperature to go out and do things and kind of be productive but also go to beach still or kind of like go for a walk in the blue skies and get nature.

Question:
And then your, the last question is, how would you describe yourself from a other person's point of view? If you had to describe you through like someone else, like what would you say?

Alexa Caramazza:
That's a really good question. I think I would probably describe myself as a very sweet and caring person who really works hard for what she wants, but also doesn't settle for less than I know I deserve, but honestly, I would just say that I'm a very hard working and determined person who really does care a lot about other people and just trying to do the best, do her best to change things that she can with the system and the way our world works.

Question:
That's awesome. Okay, well, good job. I'm gonna stop the recording. Done.

Alexa Caramazza:
Okay.


Question:
All right, first question, what's your favorite place on earth?

Alexa Caramazza:
I honestly haven't been that many places, but I would probably stay my hometown, mostly because it, oh, I'm from Lake Tahoe, California, but I'm from South Lake Tahoe I really miss like the nature aspect of it.

Question:
Where is.

Alexa Caramazza:
And the lake is just so gorgeous and the environment is so clean there. So compared to San Diego, San Diego seems a lot dirtier. Even though it's like one of the cleanest cities, it just is like a lot dirtier to me than my home because it snows so much there. So it's constantly being cleaned but I really miss it.

Question:
I know. I love Tahoe. It's so beautiful. I'm so jealous you live. What's the best TV show right now to you?

Alexa Caramazza:
The Last of us.

Question:
The last.

Alexa Caramazza:
I forgot about it and then my mom reminded me that I had watched it, and it's so good. It's like the zombie TV show, but it's about like a zombie apocalypse basically but it's one of the first TV shows I feel like I've watched that is very inclusive, with race, ethnicity and like all those types of things, especially like sexuality. Like it kind of shows like the reality of sexuality and like trying different things. But it's also just a crazy good show. I highly recommend it.

Question:
I need to watch. I've ever seen it what's the worst movie you've ever seen?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's really good.

Question:
Like, you were just like, that was so bad.

Alexa Caramazza:
I don't even know the name, honestly. It's there's some movies on Netflix or other platforms that like you'll like start and they're just so bad that you have to turn them off. I'm trying to think what there's always like those ROM com movies that just have really that acting, but sometimes they're like the acting is so bad that it's good and it's just like funny.

Question:
You don't like the.

Alexa Caramazza:
But otherwise sometimes it's a little too hard to watch.

Question:
What's one item of clothing you couldn't live without?

Alexa Caramazza:
I wear workout clothes a lot just to class, because then I go straight to the gym afterwards. But otherwise, that's a hard question. I would definitely say. Like shorts and a long sleeve. I guess.

Question:
What's your favorite workout? Like what routine?

Alexa Caramazza:
My favorite workout routine will probably be, it's definitely leg day, but. Squats are my favorite. I would say.

Question:
Squats, okay awesome.

Alexa Caramazza:
Squats or headgrass or seamless squats. I don't know. I just like leg day. It's very fun.

Question:
What's your biggest pet peeve?

Alexa Caramazza:
People being rude to service workers in that service interview. When people are mean to us, it bothers me so much, especially like if I go on a date with somebody and they aren't nice to a service worker, such as a server, a busser or a hostess. It's just an immediate red flag to me. It just shows that they don't value that person the same as they would value any other person working a different job. And it irritates me because I feel like we in the service industry work very hard. And when people aren't nice, it just kind of shows a lot about them.

Question:
What's the worst date you've ever been on? Have you been on a bad day?

Alexa Caramazza:
Hey, I've been out of. I take the worst day I think I've ever been on was with this guy and he picked me up. It was a couple, it was like two years ago, I think. But he picked me up and we were gonna go watch the sunset in LA Hoya at this beach that he knew. And he picked me up but was literally picking his fantasy league the entire time we were on the date.

Question:
No.

Alexa Caramazza:
It was so bad. It was so bad. He was, he just kept apologizing me like I'm so sorry I have to do this right now. I'm like, do you really have to do that right now? Like we're on a date or we're supposed to be on a date, but I'm not having any fun. But he was just on his phone the whole time.

Question:
That's the worst.

Alexa Caramazza:
This weird.

Question:
I think that's like one of my biggest if you could bring three things if you on a deserted island, what would you pick?

Alexa Caramazza:
It was really weird.

Alexa Caramazza:
I definitely think, can I pick water and food. I would definitely pick water cuz I feel like I can find food there, maybe. For the most part, I will bring, a first aid kit, and a solar powered phone in case of our of emergencies.

Question:
Smart. Would you rather be hot or cold?

Alexa Caramazza:
I'd rather be cold because this heat wave has definitely reminded me that I do miss the slightly cold weather. Yesterday was better, but the day before was so hot and my house doesn't have AC. It was a painful day. So I definitely think I'd rather be a little cold. Been too hot.

Question:
What's your favorite karaoke song?

Alexa Caramazza:
Before he cheats by Carrie Underwood.

Question:
That's good, if you could save one material thing from a fire, what would you save?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's so good.

Question:
So random.

Alexa Caramazza:
The material thing, I don't mean.

Question:
If your house is burning and you need to grab something, like computer or phone, like what would you grab?

Alexa Caramazza:
I think I'd probably grab, I have a hard drive. I was actually using it last night, but I have a hard drive that has all of my pictures on it. I think I would just grab that cuz even then, if I lost my phone and my computer, I have all of my photos uploaded on and I feel like my pictures are like one of the most important things to me, something that has as much as I need on it.

Question:
True. I think I would grab my computer, too. Like, what's the best meal you've ever eaten?

Alexa Caramazza:
My computer would probably be my second thing, I think.

Alexa Caramazza:
My okay. My family every year makes gipino for Christmas. It's an Italian soup. And you can aura it at restaurants and like, fancy other places, but they just make it so much better than any restaurant ever could. And it's so good, I think I would die for a bowl of it, it's so good.

Question:
In do you have a bucket list and what would be on it?

Alexa Caramazza:
I kind of do have a bucket list. I wanna travel a lot. I think I want to go bungee jumping in New Zealand. Sorry, that's my roommate's cat I want to go bungee jumping in New Zealand.

Question:
Okay.

Alexa Caramazza:
I definitely want to swim in the Nepali coast again, in Hawaii, trying to think what else. I definitely just want to do a lot of traveling, especially if I do get to go like study abroad and go to Italy and other places, have a lot to check off my bucket list.

Question:
Is there any personal goals that you wanna check off, like a list or bucket list, like things that you're working on?

Alexa Caramazza:
I'm definitely working on better eating habits. I feel like last year kind of fell into a bad phase of not eating enough and then overeating. The compensate for not eating enough, but I think definitely getting better eating habits, but also just being more consistent with my meals and cooking for myself.

Question:
Hum.

Question:
It's a good ask. What are you most thankful for right now?

Alexa Caramazza:
I'm not stable for my family. My godfather is actually visiting right now. And I before this, I took he and my mom on a tour of the SDSU campus.

Question:
Okay.

Alexa Caramazza:
Just after my 8:00am class we did a little tour. And I'm excited because he's here and we're gonna go to the project Giants game and just be around each other. And I'm excited.

Question:
When is that so fun?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's on Sunday.

Question:
How's work and everything good?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's fine. I think they're gonna fire Lily.

Question:
They haven't.

Alexa Caramazza:
No, they, I guess, have to suspend her first. Their firing process is kind of weird because they're very thorough with firing people but they have to suspend her first. Again, in order to collect evidence that she needs to be fired. I mean, they'll go through the actual process, but otherwise, I don't know. It's been fine. It's been slow, which is weird still, but.

Question:
How's the new girl?

Alexa Caramazza:
Yep, not fan.

Question:
My friend.

Alexa Caramazza:
She's okay. She just.

Question:
It's your name? I like, know her because of a friend. And she, like, applied because I told her I work there, but then I left. So I don't really know her a lot. Well, but what's your name?

Alexa Caramazza:
Malia, she Jackie kind of had has problems with her already. Just cut. I don't know. She talked a big game, I feel like, in her interviews and everything, like, saying that she was a top host and everything. But she doesn't do a lot, honestly. Like, if we'll be standing doing menus and just, like, still having a conversation, she'll just be off to the side, standing at the host stand, like, not doing anything. And she'll take her up to the bathroom, kind of disappear, like Lily does. She just, I don't think, has a good work ethic. And I don't think she understands why we get tips is because we do sidework. So I feel like she just thinks we should just get tipped anyways, but we do meaningful sideworks, and that's why we get it. I don't know eh I hope it gets better but I think they're gonna try and hire some more people as we let go of Lily but I'm just hoping that we find some other good people cuz Leah is really good. And then but right now we have Kayla me little or Malia Molly, Addie and Lexie so there's six of us but Malia and Lily are kind of on the outs. So there's like four or five of us.

Question:
Well, that. I'm out of there.

Alexa Caramazza:
Yep, that's not a fun time right now. Everyone's trying to find people that cover their shifts too especially for this weekend cuz the Giants being in town. A lot of people like within our circle are from the Bay Area. Like Lexi and Adelang really want to go to the Giants game, but I took it off. Initially planning to go to the Giants game and now they want to go, too. So I have Adeline probably won't get her shift covered, but I'll see.

Question:
Okay, well what would your perfect day look like?

Alexa Caramazza:
Answer.

Alexa Caramazza:
My perfect day, I think, would look like waking up relatively early, going to the gym and then like going to the beach or the pool with my friends, and then afterwards going to, the Ocean Beach Farmers Market or just going to get dinner and then coming home and doing a bonfire in. Our backyard.

Question:
Oh, it's cute. What does your dream life look like?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's fun. Think my dream life probably looks like working a decent amount, but also being able to take time for myself. So having a career that supports me well enough to also eventually have a family and a cute little house and being close to where my parents live. But eventually just being happy and content with where I end up. But I do want a husband or and kids and all those things.

Question:
Oh, would you rather live without the internet or without showering?

Alexa Caramazza:
I would rather live without the internet. I feel like I can find plenty of things to do, but I would not want to live without showering. I love taking showers. It's very therapeutic. I feel like it just washes away a bad day.

Question:
Do you think it's ever okay to lie and why?

Alexa Caramazza:
I think it's a very small portion of times that it's okay to lie. If you're really protecting somebody from knowing something or. Just, like a little white lie to a little kid cuz they like are old enough to comprehend something else. I feel like that's kind of acceptable. I feel like that has to happen sometimes. Trying to think when else it's okay. But other one, like in serious instances, I feel like it's not as okay. But people definitely still do it.

Question:
What would you do tomorrow if you won $1 million today?

Alexa Caramazza:
If I won $1 million today, I would buy my parents a house.

Question:
That's nice.

Alexa Caramazza:
I'd buy my parents a house and then I'd buy myself a house. So I wouldn't have to stress as much, hang on, I'm not close my door. So I think my roommates are coming home. But cat pushed it all the way open.

Question:
What is something people would never get just by looking at you?

Alexa Caramazza:
Hang on. I'm on a zoom. Oh, sorry, girl. But when people get just, will you repeat it?

Question:
What is something people would never guess just by looking at you?

Alexa Caramazza:
I think a lot of people assume that I am like, my family's more wealthy than we are. I think a lot of people would assume I just, like I'm picture perfect because I have both of my family, like both of my parental figures in my life. And then I think people think that I'm probably a lot more well off than I am. But I don't think people would realize that I'm completely independent and have been since I moved out when I was 17. So think people would assume that I am just more wealthy, I guess, my friends definitely make me laugh a lot, but I honestly think I laughed the most with my mom, my dad and my brother.

Question:
What makes you laugh the most?

Alexa Caramazza:
If you put us in a hotel room together, it is a comedy session. It's just so funny. I don't know why we always do weird things and like we just laugh for hours about it. It's really funny. There was this one time my dad, we were visiting family in monterraise, we were in a hotel room and my dad was feeding my dog, Panda, and he dropped the can of wet food onto the floor, but it landed like perfectly flat on the floor. So it like sprayed up at his face and he was not happy. But it was just so funny.

Question:
My God, that's funny. What did teachers used to say about you on your report card? And is it still true?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's definitely still true. I was always the goody two shoes kid, always had teachers, always saying outstanding student on my report card. My mom probably still has my report cards, honestly. My brothers, on the other hand, were always like talks too much, is loud in class or other things like that. But I was definitely a scholarly and academic student that was always wanting to learn. So they definitely always complemented that.

Question:
Can you recall the happiest day of your life? And like, why is.

Alexa Caramazza:
I think I can. I think probably right now the happiest day of my life would be when I found out that I got into SCSU, because I was in my bathroom of my house from last year, and I just randomly checked my email. I had been waiting to find out from schools if I had gotten in or not. And I found out from San Marcos that I got in. But San Marcos was like my last choice. It was my last resort if I didn't get into anywhere else. I wasn't able to get into UCSD because my counselor advised me not to take a class. And I ended up meeting that class. So they were trying to get me to take the class within, like four weeks or something. And I just, I couldn't do it with where I was at in the school year. It was like about to be finals and I could not. So I was really relying on SCSU. And I just randomly checked my email and I just saw, congratulations, you've been admitted from SDSU. And then I literally ran into my roommate Quincy's room and I just screamed. I got in and then she was like, wait, what? And I was like, I got into SES you. And she started freaking out. Then we both ran through the house like telling everyone. And it was just really, it was a really good moment cuz everyone was like screaming. And it was really funny.

Question:
So, oh, oh.

Alexa Caramazza:
And I called my parents, I Facetime my parents and I told them and they started screaming. And my dog actually started barking too, because he was like, what is happening? But it was just a very good moment, I think my favorite thing about myself is how kind I am and caring about other people.

Question:
What's your favorite thing about yourself?

Alexa Caramazza:
I definitely take care of others feelings more than I take care of my own, which I feel like a lot of people do, but some people definitely don't do. But I care a lot about other people.

Question:
Have you ever failed at something? And what did you do if you failed? Like what?

Alexa Caramazza:
Initially, I when I wasn't sure where I wanted to go in school, it was because, I didn't get into SCSU or any of the other schools that I initially wanted and it was Covid. So I found out that I didn't get into school. And then I had to just kind of decide where to go.

Question:
He.

Alexa Caramazza:
So I ended up going to Mesa. So I did initially fail by not getting into those schools, but I went to Mesa and then I got my associate's degree and I ended up at San Diego State anyways. So kind of just pursued the opportunity even though they said no initially, cuz I had faith that I could get in.

Question:
What do you think your purpose is in life?

Alexa Caramazza:
I think, maybe to, educate others kind of about like economic things and how are, how we need to treat our world better and each other better.

Question:
Okay. Do you believe in second chances?

Alexa Caramazza:
I do believe in second chances. I think I've given a lot of people second chances, and they either do really well with it or don't do well with it. But I think everyone deserves some form of a second chance, whether it's not in a super trusting way or you fully get them your trust again, just because they can either prove you right as. Second time and you really know who they are, or they can prove you wrong and they can stay in your life.

Question:
Definitely he. What's the biggest favor you've ever done for someone?

Alexa Caramazza:
That's a tough one. I'm not sure. Hum. I don't really know. That's a loaded question because I'm trying to think of a specific instance. I think recently one of the biggest favors I did for my roommate was moving her bed and all of her large furniture from the storage unit that we had, into our house.

Question:
Jane.

Alexa Caramazza:
Well, I helped her move it into the storage unit, and then I took it for her before she got back to San Diego. I took it for her to our new house because she wouldn't have a truck otherwise. So I just did it when I had my dad's truck.

Question:
Well, if you had to make an emergency phone call, who would it be?

Alexa Caramazza:
My mom, she always answers. If she doesn't answer, although for some reason, I feel like whenever it is an emergency, she's like on the phone with somebody else or she's busy and she doesn't answer. So I guess my dad, maybe my mom or my dad for sure. But for some reason sometimes whenever it really is like I'm having a big issue, she doesn't answer.

Question:
That's kind of funny, though. I feel like that's how my dad is, too.

Alexa Caramazza:
I know. It's like, what are the odds? Like you answer literally when I'm just calling, just a call. And then when I really need something, you don't have your phone on you or something else, like, mom, please. It's funny, though.

Question:
If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be?

Alexa Caramazza:
I would change how. I would change how everyone treats the planet and how we're ruining the ecosystem that we have entirely just for money and greed. I think I would definitely start to, make huge consequences for the large consumer companies, like gas stations, like shell and other corporations like that who are just too greedy to actually care about the environment and what they're doing to our earth, even though that's not what we want.

Question:
What is your love language?

Alexa Caramazza:
I'd say my love language is probably access service or words of affirmation. I don't like gifts or anything, but I love like if somebody were like, pump my gas for me or run in the grocery store for me because I needed something and I couldn't do that day. Small things, that help me out and kind of lift a little bit of weight off my shoulders. I feel like it's very helpful because I'm naturally a very anxious and stressed out person. So I think that's just very sweet and kind when people do those kinds of things.

Question:
Do you read or watch the news? And what topics do you pay most attention to?

Alexa Caramazza:
I've kind of steered away from reading and watching the news lately just because it was all just very sad and depressing things, that it was kind of taking a toll on my mental health, especially because I was reading so much into things such as climate change and ethnic matters or like the Maui soon was really hard for me but I definitely I was looking into those things for a really long time and just diving so deep into a hole of news and update topics. So it kind of got harder for me to read about them.

Question:
In the same way, I feel like.

Alexa Caramazza:
It's hard cuz everything is like, there's never or hardly ever any happy news. And that's just how it is. Now.

Question:
What was your first job?

Alexa Caramazza:
My first job, I was a babysitter before I had my first job. But I, my first official job was a little cafe. I was a hostess and it's called Birt's Cafe. And it's right in the middle of town. It was very close to my high school too. But I was just a hostess and I worked in the mornings. And we closed that like two in the afternoon. So it was always nice to be able to get work done, and then I'd have the rest of the day to do other things.

Question:
What is your work now?

Alexa Caramazza:
I work at watergrow in downtown, and I'm a hostess.

Question:
What do you like? What is it like to be a host to set Water Girl?

Alexa Caramazza:
It's very fun. I love the environment. I love the people. We definitely have some hard times with the construction that we're doing at the moment, but we've definitely made some improvements, and I'm hoping that will hire some more hosts so I can work a little bit less, so I can focus more on school. But otherwise, I love most of my coworkers, most.

Question:
Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Alexa Caramazza:
I'll be 25. I think I see myself maybe with a serious partner and a very steady job, and hopefully my first pet, maybe a cat, maybe a dog, maybe both, depending on where I live. But I'm hoping by then I'll be able to find a stable place to live and maybe start looking for houses.

Question:
Good have you ever had to break up with a friend and why?

Alexa Caramazza:
I have had to break up with a couple of friends the friendship was just more one sided for me. And I feel like they were always putting weight on my shoulders with their issues, but never really having the time to listen to me when I had a major problem, or just not respecting me and my boundaries or kind of just shutting me out when I didn't really have the energy to talk about all of their problems at the same time. But right now, I feel like all of my friends are very understanding of my energy and my time. So I don't feel like they completely traumatic on me every time I see them, but we mutually can have a conversation and relate to each other, but also leave space for each other.

Question:
How many close friends is ideal for you?

Alexa Caramazza:
That number is definitely changed since I got out of high school. I think my number of close friends has expanded a lot. It used to be like two or three people, but now I have three roommates, but I also have two other friends who are very close to me. And then all my coworkers also know I feel like everything about me because I feel like we just talk about ourselves and our lives, so much so, but I would say my ideal is probably 5,5,6 or seven because I feel like I have a lot of close friends at the moment, think just having somebody say that I was, a good person, feel like that's a really good compliment.

Question:
Me?

Question:
What's the best compliment you've received are, do you remember.

Question:
What is leadership look like for you?

Alexa Caramazza:
For me, leadership definitely looks like taking a stand for things that not everyone believes in necessarily, or taking a stand for things that are right, regardless of whether or not people want to believe that.

Question:
Have you ever been in a situation where you had to step up and be a leader?

Alexa Caramazza:
Yes, I definitely have been trying to think of an example.

Alexa Caramazza:
With my moving out situation, I definitely had to stand up and be a leader because all of my roommates, all six of my roommates left before the least was up within this last term that I was living with them. And they all left without doing any of the health cleaning. They barely clean their own rooms. So I had to step up and get the security deposit back for all of us. And it was not a fun time to be a leader, but it happen.

Question:
They. What's the most exciting part of your job?

Alexa Caramazza:
Most exciting part about my job, probably the friends that I've made and walking into work and getting to see who I work with that day is always really fun. Cuz I don't really check the schedule to see who I work with. So walking in, I'm always kind of, oh, my God, like Lexie or Question:

Question:
What is your strictest boundary in relationships?

Alexa Caramazza:
My strictest boundary for sure is no cheating. I've vented that plenty of times and I don't need to go through it again. But I would definitely say another boundary of mine would be respecting my time. I am a very timely person, and I need somebody who respects that and isn't super late to hang out with me or canceling plans or other things like that.

Question:
What does self worth look like to you? Like how do you keep yourself in check? And how do you, like for a girl, too, what does it look like for you to keep yourself motivated and worth, feel like you're worth it?

Alexa Caramazza:
For me, a lot of it has to do with how I take care of myself, with my eating and my workout habits. I've noticed that I just feel a lot better about myself, not just physically, but emotionally when I I'm working out, because I have somewhere to target my energy to. And I feel like that's very helpful in my self worth journey. But I think a lot of it, too, has been meeting people who value me rather than people who don't treat me well, but otherwise, not sure. I think a lot of it definitely just has to do with how I treat myself and how I would think somebody else would want to be treated. And I don't want to treat myself worse when I treat other people.

Question:
What is your self care look like?

Alexa Caramazza:
Myself can probably taking a shower to detox, washing my hair and doing my skincare team, but also drinking a lot of water. Watching a TV show or movie and, just taking a little bit of time to focus on myself, instead of being like on my phone or like completely trying to distract myself with homework or something.

Question:
What are some typical issues that you feel like you or your friends or people in college face? What do you think are some issues?

Alexa Caramazza:
Some issues that I think a lot of people face are. Mental health issues, especially from social media and building new relationships, but also having no good background of relationships for a lot of people for, but I think otherwise, probably financial stress and just an overwhelming, like, new environment that we have to get used to with living by ourselves for the first time. But I think a lot of people in college struggle with that. And just like pursuing what.

Question:
Do you, how do you think there's a way to help fix it? Or do you think there's anything that helps that with those issues?

Alexa Caramazza:
For financial stress, applying for scholarships definitely helps I've applied to a lot of scholarships and I actually haven't been awarded any within the time that I've been, in college, which is stressful in itself because I applied at Mesa and I didn't get anything. So that was really hard. But otherwise, for friendships, I think a lot of it is just trial and error. But staying true to who you are and who you wanna hang out with is very important. Cuz I think I was trying to be friends with people who wanted more materialistic things, and I'm just not a materialistic person, but kind of just saying true to who you think you are in the moment.

Question:
If.

Alexa Caramazza:
Even if that changes, that's okay, too. But being susceptible to change is very important.

Question:
If you had to be a role model to a bunch of people, what would you focus on to help them with that you feel like you could? Can I help them navigate?

Alexa Caramazza:
I think I would definitely help people navigate how to, kind of help their mental health, especially through like physical endurance or just daily affirmations or something like that. Because I think a lot of what I've helped my friends with is them learning how to make better meals through me, or also just doing things to take care of themselves, whether it's going to the beach by yourself, meditating or doing other things. I think I could just help with giving new students or younger people or older people just guidance on how to take care of yourself more and take care of your mental health.

Question:
Alright, that was my last question do you feel like there's anything you wanna share about yourself that you would want in AI to know about, you that you haven't said already?

Alexa Caramazza:
Not okay.

Alexa Caramazza:
I don't know. I don't think so. I think we've kind of covered a lot of the bases within this session and the last session. Do you have any other questions that you think I should answer?

Question:
Just I feel like your morals, your values, like, what you stand for is important talked a little bit about that, like.

Alexa Caramazza:
I would just say that I definitely stand for equity rather than Equality, cuz I think a lot of people aren't treated the same within our social system and our justice system, but I think making up for, inequality is definitely very important. But also I think just taking care of others and, not being where do people or taking out your anger on people or just taking advantage of people's kindness and their money or anything like that, I think it's really important.

Question:
Alright, well, I'm gonna stop the recording.
