Question:
First question, what's your favorite way to spend a weekend?

Anthony Moore:
Let's see. My favorite way to spend the weekend. My weekends are typically filled with me catching up from the week. So filling in homework or meeting with some of my mentors. But if I don't have anything like that going on I'm very big on personal care and especially when it comes to growing. So I love working out. I love I can get when my homies will climb accounts mountain every now and then, hanging out and going into my hobbies. I play bass guitar, my meantime. So I love mastery. I love learning new things picking up a couple songs on base of my free time. Just kind of taking the time to slow down and to kind of invest in myself from the week. Because typically my weeks are pretty packed. So I just take some time to relax and just work on myself a bit.

Question:
What school do you go to?

Question:
Are you a senior?

Anthony Moore:
I am a 2nd year, is my 2nd year as a community college student.

Question:
So you're doing data science, right?

Anthony Moore:
Yes. My major, here's a little weird. And my major actually is Applied Mathematics. I will leaving here. I'll be leaving here in my. So she's in my mathematics, but I do a mixture of math courses. So all the general math and advanced maths and some computer science courses as well, because that would be needed for my transfer over. My dream school is UC Berkeley. So I wanna go with the Berkeley and probably be admitted in the problematic program in minor data science. So I do a lot of math and a lot of physics and a lot of computer science. So I, I have a, I'm a bit of mixture of the student, honestly.

Adrina:
Awesome. You're wearing the Berkeley colors already. You're already ready to go.

Anthony Moore:
Get the Berkeley. I'm hoodie. I'm ready to go.

Question: Have you been to Berkeley?

Anthony Moore:
Oh, definitely. I spent a weekend over there like a couple weeks ago in the dorms for a conference, and that was my first taste campus and I just fell in love. And I was, I'm coming back here. So now that's this, I'm gonna be this my mission I think myself care first starts with me taking a deep dive and myself, and me asking what do I need myself?

Question:
What does your self care look like? You said you're into self care. What does that look like for you?

Anthony Moore:
Right now, my feel like sometime my life is really fast to where I don't really have time to really sit down and think of my needs. So I think of what do I need? And typically it's along lines of I just need to work on my confidence, I need to clear my head. So a big way I do that is just going to therapy, like to see my therapist biweekly. That is a big thing in my opinion.

Anthony Moore:
I come a friend from a family who is who's not too deep in their self care. So I make sure that I'm right so I can do what I need to do. Another big thing is hang on my friends. I love working out. I grew up pretty obese. So when I was in high school, I really put a lot of time into my physical. Now, even though I'm in a great spot physically, I still make time to just work on my body, even though I'm not too big on physical appearance, but I think it makes me stronger mentally. So s things like that, like reinforcing myself to prepare myself for things I wanna fulfill. That's myself. It looks like in me asking myself, what do I need out of myself mentally to face these challenges.

Question:
That's really cool do you have a favorite childhood memory?

Anthony Moore:
We think that's a good one for some reason when that comes, the mind is I think I was maybe like, I was maybe like 7 or 8 and my mother was married to my previous stepfather, and he had a son named Dante. And a big part of me is that I recognize no matter what happens to a person, I think it's everyone's job to be a good person. No matter what happens, you strive every day to spread love into make people, other people happy. Yourself first, you can't pour from empty glass, but do you work to make other people happy or to help other people in a sense.

Anthony Moore:
So deante was new to our family and it was his first time being around a big family function. It was Christmas, all my family was there. And Rudy was very new. My mom said my mom's my old stepfather. And Dionte was also very new to our family. So it was a little awkward for them. They didn't, they, the auntie didn't really feel like he fed in too much. And our family would bring over presents for all of the kids and I, I wouldn't, I get presents for my mom, my aunties, my uncles and etc. Right? And the auntie is very new. He didn't really get any presents that day. So I remember I was given this really big RC car, cuz I like RC cars. And so I was like, twelve when it's something things like huge, like it says, like a pretty, a reasonably large box and I also got a smaller one that Christmas and it was a regular size RC card. And I notice the onte, like he wasn't really feeling too well. And I realize this might have been a lot for him cuz he's moving to a new house, new family. He really messes his mom, so I gave him my RC car. And then I remember my grandfather talking me tell me about how important it is to be kind to people and how important is to, to show a level of humanity. So I think that as I think back to my childhood and morals that I still hold on to right now, I think that one's pretty prevalent.

Adrina:
I love that. That's so cute. 

Anthony Moore:
Right? I think it's very easy to be negative and to be just very just negative over, over. And a lot of people justification is when I was ex, this happened to me. When I was in, this happened me, right? They use kind of like their past and to justify kind of behavior. And it's very reasonable to be heard from the past, right? But I strongly believe that. And as someone who's been through a few things myself, no matter what happens to you, it is your duty to become a good person. Because if something happens in the past and you're just, you're hurting other people, are you any better? As in that I had to learn myself growing up. So I'm very big on just kindness and just in being a human, like being a good human, man, it's a lot.

Question:
Is there anything you would tell your younger self today?

Anthony Moore:
To stop being your worst enemy. Like a lot of times when I was younger I fed into certain mentalities about myself that I just, I s I wrote that's just me and how it's gonna be and it's never gonna be anywhere else. And I have to learn that if I wanted things to change my life, I would have to change my outlook on myself.

Anthony Moore:
One thing that I grew up, Thomas up is that I'm stupid or I don't pick people. I'm not very social. And even though I grew up being told I was released, I really smart kid and I was pretty sociable, for some reason like I these came into my head which was pretty much me picking up other people viewed me, but I had to learn that the only person who tell me who I am is me. And I decide on how I want my life to become.

Anthony Moore:
Of course, life is tough thing it did. There are things that you can't really control. But for the most part as your character, if you want friends and you say that you're not very social and you just, you stay conceded in yourself, you're not gonna have any friends. If you're in college and you wanna get good grades, but I'm gonna study here and I don't wanna study, you're not gonna get good grades. So you're gonna have to be religious in times. And if you want things to happen in your life that are good, the change and do things you never done before and be uncomfortable and try new things. So I think, I just tell myself to, just to stop holding on to what you think is you and just be who you wanna be see let's see, so, I am, I live with my great grandparents and reason, because I never group my father.

Question:
What are some things that you've gone through that you feel like you could talk about and, like, share with others and kind of give advice to kids and other people?

Anthony Moore:
I never knew my father. Too much I know of him, but we never, we don't have a connection or relationship. And my mother moved away from me when I was 15 because she had her own things going on with herself, mentally. And she, she, she really couldn't provide for me like she need to and she need to focus on herself. And we still talk today, but that was a reason for our splitting.

Anthony Moore:
So I live, my grandparents and I live a long time in isolation. High school, I didn't have to new friends and talk to many people. And I would just kind of like I was really just waiting for us, from someone to save me. And I was really just, I was alone and I felt like I didn't have anyone to grab on to. So I start working at a library as a San Diego public library is really big, don't home library. And that's where I kind of learn to like this mentality where it's like, I don't believe in meritocracy. I don't believe in meritocracy. And meritocracy is that you're hard. Depending on how much work you put in, it directly correlates how much things you get in life. I don't believe that's how hard work works, the hard work works. But I do believe that if you want reasonable change to happen in your life, you're going to have to put your best foot forward and just try, no matter what's going on I would tell people from my experiences, if they feel alone, if they don't have too many peers, if they don't have any the things that hold on to, I will just let them know that it's gonna be okay and I understand that.

Anthony Moore:
I really understand people who are who come from backgrounds where they don't have some support parents or they don't have people to hold on to but there's plenty of people around you. Find a community people around you who are willing to help you. So I think that is something that I often share people to motivate them to, they're struggling with study habits or struggling with I'm a tutor, struggling setting struggling with losing weight. I'm like if you need something, the change in your life the best place to start with this with yourself and I probably share that cuz I am, I do a lot with my time right now and I grew up feeling like I couldn't do what I need to do, cuz I didn't have what other kids had or what do they had. But it was up to me to reach out to other resources and to make it, even make use of them into realize my experience is very unique. And but that's okay because life is no sometimes you can't control what happens but you can still put your best foot forward, no?

Anthony Moore:
Right, right.

Adrina:
So it's like at least you have someone. 

Anthony Moore:
I think a good mindset goes a long way. And I think that that's why I'm really big on self care, especially monthly. Cuz a lot of people they really struggle with adopting good mindsets. And in my grandparents, they know they're, they have their flaws, bumps, exam but, but that's okay cuz I do have roof for my head.

Anthony Moore:
I do have very loving friends. I do have my grandparents. Lona's miracle, I have my grandparents, my great grandparents, I live, my great grandparents, they're alive. So I can still see them move and talk to me. So there's a lot that I don't have, but there's a lot that I do have and I'm very blessed and I'm very privileged to have so I think a good mindset goes a long way and and comparison is a thief of joy I was I would always say to myself like I don't have Xynz's parents or? They bought their kid a car and I'm just I'm sitting here but what I do have and what I can make out of what I do have is great and I'm just gonna keep working on what I do have and and helping others along the way.

Question:
 What's your go to comfort food?

Anthony Moore:
Sushi or pho. I'm really big into Asian cuisine for some reason, but and, okay, this is one spot.

Adrina:
Where is their good pho? 

Anthony Moore:
I think it's on University Avenue that is really I it's called like Fa Nam something. It's like on university. And it's so good. And they have amazing fur. Now, I only know San Diego fur, so I can't tell you if it's like top tier fur. But from what I know in my little local area, that was good. I'm also sushi.

Question:
 But I can't how do you spell it?

Anthony Moore:
I found it's called Fa Nam Kelly. It is this little spa on University Avenue and it's fur fho, space n a m space C a L I.

Adrina:
Got it.

Anthony Moore:
Is great.

Adrina:
Oh, that so good.

Anthony Moore:
Get the house.

Adrina:
That looks so fire 3.

Anthony Moore:
That is my comfort food. Something about like how natural, how earthy  and feel sometimes. But she would they throw in there in the bean sprouts and just the meat, like something about how if it was very kind of like primitive, it feels very just like natural, like earthy. And I just, I love the feeling of it and it's great. Soup is also like my, a big thing about me. And like I love my grandparents. So I'm a bit of old soul. So soup and stuff like that, it kind of gets me a little bit.

Question:
Let's see what's your favorite music? What kind of music do you like?

Anthony Moore:
Some music is, is, is a really big part of my life. It is everyone's, but I feel very intimate connection with music cuz that's kind of how I, when I didn't have a therapist, kind of how I express myself, finding songs that related to my experience, that's hard right now I'm in my 2 rock era with tool and such. But I think probably my favorite music for all time my favorite ours would be tired creator. Like I got me through high school and he make so he he's very big to me. Cuz he is as a black man, I feel like there's no a lot of artists who can properly display like or who have the courage or display their feelings. Cuz it's a Sigma Black man of us in society that we're very stoic and we're very tall and large. And we're very like conceded by Flag Tyler his music like him looking like me and him talking about films that I feel like, it's just different. It's different when you listen to some music and they look like you and they sound like you and they have some interests you, and they're talking about these things they feel and it's like, I can feel it. Like I know I understand what you're saying, understand what you feel. And I, it touches me very deeply. Probably my favorite album from him is probably like, if you ask any Tyler fan, they probably say no. But I love Cherry Bomb. Cherry Bomb is great. And probably like alternative hip hop, which is probably the umbrella he falls in. Alternative hip hop and stuff like that is my favorite. I also have a soft spot for Regi and. And all forms of rock music.

Adrina:
Oh, I like Tyler. I'm not a huge fan, but I definitely like him.

Anthony Moore:
I know everything about Tyler. Like it's actually kind of crazy. Everything I know, eh?

Question:
Have you seen him in concert?

Anthony Moore:
I, I, this my dying wish. It's like my dying wish. I wanna see Tyler and Kendrick so bad. Like as my dying wish, I'm like shriveled and old on a gospel, but I was like, what is it? I remember what gonna make it, gonna make it happen?

Question:
If you could meet any historical figure, who would it be? They can be alive, too. Or just anyone.

Anthony Moore:
Any historical figure. If I could be any historical figure, what can, what would I be? Man, that's a tough one I feel like I'm drawing a blank right now, but my mind, my mind instantly goes to someone like Malcolm X, probably Malcolm X because, well, I feel like his story is very similar to a lot of people who come from my path is not a very good childhood. There's a lot to in his childhood that led him to a certain life that he lived for a second. And then he kind of went to prison and then he had this awakening where I, he, I think he, regardless on views and he had when it comes to politically or, or religiously, he had an idea that being educated was probably the best thing for him right now. And kind of diving into himself and learning more about himself and the world around him would be the best situation for him at the moment.

Anthony Moore:
So I think that kind of story I resonate with being in this place where it's kind of very dark and there's not much to hold on to. And then you kind of recognize I need to just look in words, educate myself and to just kind of see what's around me and then reach out. And I really, the things that he's able to do and the movement is able to have coming from those beginnings is pretty inspiring. And also I just love educated dude. So so my big goal, like life goal right now, and this is like, this is it.

Question:
what's a goal you're currently working towards?

Anthony Moore:
I want to go to UC Berkeley. I that's my thing. That's my thing on campus. I'm the Berkeley dude. I'm the guy who wants to go to Berkeley. So that is something that I, I'm picking up every sort of extracurricular to try, it's my classes for and even just talk representatives Berkeley.

Anthony Moore:
That's something that I, I've been wanting to do since last year. I have a plenty of amazing mentors who's been the Berkeley who is told me in the past, they see me at that school and I'm just, I'm doing all this stuff in school and all sorts of ash regulars just to get there.

Anthony Moore:
I, I, I know exactly when I do my life. I feel like being at Berkeley would just be an amazing experience from what I've been able to experience so far from there, so I'm just right now I'm taking calculus to physics 1,95 and a backcities class.

Anthony Moore:
I'm taking class in Laney College up in, up near Berkeley right now. I went to Africa this summer for a study abroad. So right now I'm putting all my, like my attention on school right now, edge regulars, so I can transfer over to university like Berkeley or similar to Berkeley or to me, that matters. So I'm very academically inclined. I really want to get this cool thing right I had a study abroad this summer, like late June to Rwanda, Kenya or vicious.

Question:
You went to Africa?

Anthony Moore:
And it was a, it was like a little mini city bud for about three weeks. They called a cultural excursion but it was tied to school and I'm getting credits for. We went to Rwanda, learn about the Rwanda genocide and we learn about the key history of Kenny and Jamaican data. We Learned that we went to Mauritius. Just kind of the chill. Honestly, Marisha is pretty low key but the trip was, was a was a fill of a lot of a lot of messages about humanity and about oneness of people.

Anthony Moore:
So I got to experience that like anything in that caliber, I'm just trying to reach out and just expand my horizons so I can be prepare cared for institution like Berkeley.

Anthony Moore:
Like I didn't even leave the country before this experience. But thanks to a lot of mom groups on part of I was able to network around and meet a lot of people. And I was able to be on the list for that. So I think traveling alone, like traveling and just seeing the world and being on a plane for 16 hours was crazy.

Question:
what's your favorite type of dessert?

Anthony Moore:
Man, you can't go wrong with ice cream. Honestly. I feel like that just the correct answer. Cuz it's like even if you like other desserts, you can put a scoop of it on top of it. It just becomes way better.

Anthony Moore:
Oh, probably like probably ice cream. I'm a big  for peanut butter and chocolate combinations. So my mom may do. My mom would make these. These, it would be like the bottom is kind of like Reese's peanut butter, kind like thick and like a layer top on top. It was like really low bars. It was so good.

Anthony Moore:
I try my best to eat healthy nowadays, but every Monday, right.

Anthony Moore:
We feel that is definitely a bounce out with all things in life and some moderation every now and then. Eat that donut dude. It's not that serious. You know, you said like we, they could cut for at least a week it right.

Anthony Moore:
Let me then let me, you know, it's a cut the cut bulk like cycle is real and it's something to be theory.

Question
What's a language you'd love to learn?

Anthony Moore:
I feel like the the correct answer would be. Spanish. I need to just hurry up with that and I know very like minimal Spanish to where I could probably get by in Mexico on, like just say it again. Just kind of thinking like processing in my head like, but I think it'd be just probably better if I were just a point in it, like I'd be able to communicate a lot more and I be able to elements Indigo. So these last many speakers here. So I thought that just the right answer. But if I were to say one that just like unrelated.

Question
How do you know that is?

Anthony Moore:
Swahili is like a eastern advocate language. So most East African country speaks wailly. So like Rwanda where I went to Kenya, Somalia, they speak Swahili. And a lot of my, I'm gonna claim code emojah and oh, so I hear your Arabic by the way, and I click hold emojia. And a lot of the students who are in that club are from East African locations like us, Somalia in Nigeria and Kenya. So I think that'd be pretty dope I think my biggest like my biggest soft skill kind of hard school ish is I'm just a, great problem solver I I love solving problems and I love finding solutions to problems no matter what it is that's why excel and math, a lot cuz this I love being like oh what's the answer this and kind of like the going all I got added.

Question:
 what's a skill you're proud of?

Anthony Moore:
So I think that is a great skill that I have and I think that transit not just academically my life, but just personally. This thing I'm dealing with right now, I'm like, how can I solve? How can I work on this? How can I better improve myself for things around me? So I think that is probably like that skill actually might be like one of my biggest traits is, is being a great problem solver. So I'd say a problem solver.

Question:
what's a small thing that never fails to make you happy?

Anthony Moore:
Small thing that never feels make me happy small thing that never fails will make me happy. I feel like if I were to narrow it down, I would say I just say the weather. I feel like the weather like the thing. I'm like a clear sky like today oh, no, something about the weather just infectious. I'm just in a good mood automatically the probably like early morning as the sun just rose, it's still kind of like a little not too bright outside, maybe like 6 ish. That type of atmosphere just feel so nice. But she was if it just ranges like that, it's a little kind of like moggy around sometimes.
Anthony Moore:
Weather atmospheres make me very like I feel very happy I would probably say making people laugh. I don't know. I like make people laugh. I like kind of being a little goofy. I like mezzanine. So people's making people laugh is is is a great thing as well. That I that makes me happy regardless what's going on.

Question:
 Are you a fan of documentaries?

Anthony Moore:
Yes, I think I'm a fan of, I'm anything that has to do with like data inquiry. So anything that has like researchers and they run tests and then they go, okay, here's what we found and this is, we're gonna do now or this we, we were, we found our insights. That's really wanna do my career as well.

Anthony Moore:
Data science. It's literally what that is is data inquiry. So there's a documentary on Netflix called The Great Hack where it's about how this one data science company was kind of fraudulent in the. 2016 election and it kind of goes through how important data is and how oh, it can be weaponized and used as a weapon to for good or for evil stuff like that when it when it hones into mathematical principles and in data science or computer science and how it can affect the real world. Like really stuff like that is pretty great to me and there's a lot of documentaries and podcast about that right now with the whole AI thing going on. So there's a lot to unpack with that.

Question:
What do you think of the AI thing? 

Anthony Moore:
So I have a big opinion on the AI thing. I feel like it's just one of those things that roll around every century or so that people are like, oh my God it's gonna kill us all happen with books having with everything having with like electricity and and phones and is gonna happen. Everything that we bring into and to our space as creators as we do we bring new things and never seen before and people go, my God it's gonna kill us but I think there's definitely fewer AI especially when machine learning cuz machine learning can have a lot of biases especially when it comes to racial biases but I think that AI is something that we tell what to do. So it all depends on who's whose hands is is it's in. I think it's a great tool to use, but I think in moderation is like AI art going around. I think that no matter what technology use, you cannot replicate art. It's a human expression. And even if you'd like tell like chatgbt to write me an essay, you're in a crappy little essay cuz it can't, it's not a human. It doesn't have the human touch. So I think that AI will serve to for its service purpose as a tool. But I think that in the long run when it comes to things or just human expression, I don't think I would be able to hold up. And I think that's already been proven with AI are looking kind of wonky. AI, like AI written essays like is pretty obviously AI. You know, you can definitely tell the difference between them. So I think it's a great tool. But I don't think it's anything to be fear necessarily, AI person.

Question:
What do you think if they had like an AI person, though, that was like a robot?

Anthony Moore:
I think it would just be a robot. Like it would be like. The that's going to like some futuristic stuff where it's like robot, that that's a tricky, an AI person cuz then you have to like AI rights, like what the rights of AI have kind of AI do this in that.
Anthony Moore:
Maybe it's, I don't know. That's a good question. I don't know about that one. That might be some. That's a little scary in case robots rise and they become like people say, don't let's we'll burn this clip.
Anthony Moore:
But I think, I don't know. I think it's just I don't think we have the, well, from when I'm aware of, I don't think we have the like the technology to make it to our AI and humans is indistinguishable. I think as long as humans are humans air AI it's gonna be very different.

Question:
are you an optimist or a pessimist?

Anthony Moore:
Definitely an optimist. I'm I well I think that sometimes I can get caught up and pessimistic behavior, but I firmly believe in you you're your mentality is you your mentality everything's how you see things so you're gonna be a pessimist. Your lives can be negative and I want a good life personally so I'm try to be optimist and see things as glass how full? I think in every situation we can derive a lesson and I know I think no matter how hard things are we can derive like, something do after this or what's the good in this at least? So I think that I'm definitely an optimist. I try to be optimistic by day. I'm a human. Things happen. I can be crappy and poopy sometimes, but I think for the most part, I'm an optimist.

Question:
Do you enjoy stargazing or astronomy?

Anthony Moore:
I don't think I often like just sit down outside and just look at starts. I'm blind, even though I'm wearing glasses, but I still have a trouble seeing. So I'm. I don't really sit down and look at stars, but I do enjoy constellations. I do enjoy. I have a decent interest in physics. So I do surely astrophysics. It's pretty good. It's pretty great. I find just space pretty interesting. I think it's terrifying, but I do think I have an interest in astrology and I have a couple of of mentors who are within the aerospace kind of, market. So that is interesting little topic, but it's not really like my main interest, but it is cool.

Question:
If you had to describe yourself through someone else's view, how would you describe yourself?

Anthony Moore:
I see someone else's view. I think there's probably like two views of me and people who know me, people who are who kind of like, my best friend would probably say, he probably said that I'm decently kind, but I'm real.
Anthony Moore:
Cuz I am. I believe that if I can't talk to you like real, and I can't be honest with you and express my as opinions, and I don't know why we've been friends. So sometimes my best friend are going to me, I'm like, dude, why are you doing that? You shouldn't be doing that. You shouldn't be doing that. And I feel like he comes to me a lot for that really, real kind of shake. I need a real answer, real opinion here. So I'm nice. I, I only, the truth has to be hurtful, but I am real I, and you probably say that I'm, I'm always doing something.
Anthony Moore:
I'm always pretty busy. Cuz I am pretty busy all the time. So I try to be a, I try to be someone who appears to be hard working. I find a lot of joy in applying myself. So a hard worker who is kind and probably keep it real.

Question:
What's the habit you're trying to develop?

Anthony Moore:
Habit is actually a few things I'm trying to develop. Well semester just started so I'm just I'm trying to get an actual routine study guy down with work and then school in the mix. But just a regular habit that just kind of like a hobbies in front of just read more. I don't read like crazy often every now and then I'll find a book that I'm super interested in. But I actually I just I struggle at building the habits and the discipline. They just sit there and quiet and read a book cuz I wanna go do everything else. So funny enough, I'm actually reading a book called Atomic Habits by James Clear, which is literally a book about how to build solid habits. So I'm just, I'm chipping away at it every day and trying to just sit down and read a book. Kind of feel like there'd be lots to learn from these books and lot things to pick up. So I wanna, I definitely want that to be a part of my arsenal when it come to having a lifelong learner. I'm gonna have to sit down or read a few books.

Question:
What's your favorite way to start the day?

Anthony Moore:
Everybody start day I think, well, there's a few answers that I think that my favorites are date, depending on how early I'm about and if it's like 6 ish with the sun just came up, I just I go out to my backyard and I see my dog and I just kind of, I just chill for a second. Me and my buddies have a thing where it's called the great stare. You were just like in the morning, you're just like, but you're staring at a wall. I just I go outside and I like my backyard just stare at the sky for a second. Just kind of process things. It's a nice atmosphere that early morning like dusk. So probably and just see my dog is also grizzly as my, my dude. So seeing him also just ease my nervous system. So probably just going outside first thing in the morning seeing this guy and just processing the new day.

Question:
What's the best piece of advice you've ever received?

Anthony Moore:
Yes, see, but as ever received, I had to think back cuz I see a lot. But peace and wise ever received.

Anthony Moore:
The, I'd probably say. Me and my great grandfather, we don't really see eye to eye too much. He's pretty like he's a really old way of thinking. He's I'd say he's all, I'd say he's stuck in his old ways. But every now and then he'll drop on, I got on like, , that's kind of true. And you know, because I'm pass up someone who's very like conceded in someone who's very like kind of self centered. I don't have too many friends, I don't really care too much. And he told me this one thing and then he says people are meant to live alone. Like people aren't meant to be alone. People are meant to live alone and need help from somebody and to help somebody. So he was, he also mean that people are no one's meant to live alone. And it typically be after I'm doing some like, oh I have a problem but I didn't ask everybody to do it myself, cuz it's kind of thing I would do. Who is like no one's meant to live alone.

Anthony Moore:
You're not meant to do things alone. As a human, we're here for a reason. So just get used to that, you know, be a part, being a part of the human races. We're not meant to live alone or do things alone. We're all need help, we're only need assistance. So that's one thing.

Anthony Moore:
Also, nothing good comes easy. That's another thing. My mom was, I mean, nothing good comes easy. And that's something that I keep in mind when I'm struggling through my calculus classes. Nothing good comes easy. It's gonna be really crappy and hard, but it's good. So it's gonna be hard.

Question:
Do you have a favorite season and why?

Anthony Moore:
Maybe season. I probably have to say, it's a tab between fall and winter. I probably say, that's tricky. Cuz I like winter, but I don't like January. Cuz in February, my like 10 minutes, those months I probably say like fall. I probably say fall is probably my favorite semester that semester. See, look at me in the school far favorite season, probably because just you got them with summer. People are pro are getting back to their work or school. And I feel like typically fall is like a turning of a new page for me. Fall feels re like reinventing myself and kind of getting back to the near to the old, getting back to what I really wanna do. And the weather is getting a little cooler. It's kind of chilling out. So I feel like I'm gonna fall feels very low key for some other reason. The trees are turning, it's getting a little cooler. Things are going back in the motion. I think winter is a cold second but winter is also when like break rolls around and I, I s I suffer during break cuz I can't not do nothing. Like I need to do something. So fall is fall probably my favorite season.

Anthony Moore:
I hate it, hate doing nothing. Like I that's the reason why I kind of have copies like working out or playing bass or or picking up anything that's random, like. That's randomly hard cuz I just, I like the idea of fulfillment. I like the idea of progression. I love mastery. So I doing nothing is so lucky to me.

Question:
 What do you think your love languages in terms of friendships and romantic relationships?

Anthony Moore:
What is their time? So, my love language in terms of friendships in Romantic 2, probably like just affirmations, like just good, good talk. I like helping people cuz a lot of people think they need their morale boost a good, like just, hey, you can do it. I believe in you. Affirmations would probably be a pretty high up there. I've always been a pretty see, I don't like people touching me, but I give you a hug in a heartbeat. I'm saying I like giving out big hugs. I like stuff like that probably so physical to an extent but also just like affirmations and just and it's kind of being there. I like being people's rock. I like being someone who you can come for council if you're having a hard time, call me if you're very good time, call me always my friends, let's share it good in a bad day. So I like being that kind of rock for people and just being there and in moderation, you can't always pour from empty cup but when I'm available emotionally and mentally, I'm glad to be there for someone who's having a hard time.

Question
And then from this year, what is your rose and your thorn? So like your rose being the best thing to happen to you, your thorn being the worst?

Anthony Moore:
I'm gonna see my rows on my phone. What's the best thing to happen this year, I think the best thing that happened to me this year is like is how said word where you can, like you can see, you can envision you can, I can. I'm trying to say like I see and understand now fully what I want to do and the path that I need to walk.
Anthony Moore:
Now. I feel like a lot of times in college and in life, people are s are really unaware of what to do next. And they're searching for like what do I do? Like who, who am I? And I feel like this last year, in the beginning of this year, I really kind of spent some time thinking about what are my values and what do I want out of myself and who wanna be? So I think the best thing this year that I've been offered is just kind of like some fourth.

Anthony Moore:
It's unclarity some clear vision like it's it's very clear to me. It's clear to me what I need to do what I want who I am with my values what I like I what I don't like so I think clear vision in the strong sense of who I am and what I want is big. My biggest probably rose is semester but this I'm so in school right now the semester start I'm school crazy this year. I think my thorn I don't think I have Thor I I think I'm keep roses been pretty awesome my phone.
Anthony Moore:
What's what's bad happen this year? I guess my sisters are about to move to Maryland and I'm saying here cuz I wanna finish at my school here. So they're moving Maryland, my mom and they're and I must stay here and I'm I'm pretty, I'm just I'm sad about it but I'm not like distraught by any means cuz I feel like we have a clear understanding of why I'm staying and why they're going. So it feels more like I'll see you later and I'll just be here and but that is something. Oh, I should never mind scratch that. My best friend actually my best friend just left for the Coast Guard. And man, that was hard to see him go away.
Anthony Moore:
We've been friends for like five years and I was in high school, I was pretty depressed. And he was like just a beacon of light as my best. But like his family like op suddenly open arms. He's just a amazing dude. We share a lot of values and morals. And he's leaving for his own adventure. So saying goodbye to him was pretty heart wrenching. But he's riding to me back and forth why he's in boot camp and he's saying, what's up? Do you know? Tell me how what's up? So, so that's probably the thorn. But like I said, I also I'm also I'm optimist so I'm very happy for it and I'm very glad for him. I know that we'll see each other again, but that was a hard thing to swallow.

Question
would you guys make for your barbecue?

This burgers brought worse. The ribs. My grandmother made some like pasta, salad, corn, all kinds of thing. Thanks. We have beans and whatnot. It was quite good.

Question:
Do you wanna just start off by kind of giving me a rundown of your elementary school years to middle school years and, like, what that was like and growing up and stuff? Just give me a little rundown of like, wow, you grew up in s everything.

Anthony Moore:
I can do that. So I grew up. With my single mother. And we grew up in San Diego, primarily living with my grandparents, who I live with now. And across the street from my grandparent's house, there is Johnson Elementary School. It's a magnets. It's a magnet school. And my grandmother works there as a cafeteria lady, and she still does what she did when I was going there. She still does. And I went there in elementary when I from. From all the way through elementary, some first to fifth grade.
I left Johnson and then I went to Clay Elementary. It's like it's in San Diego as well. I forget the area, but this is the elementary school I went for 5th grade. And I was a, I wasn't the best kid in elementary. To. I get in trouble a lot, mostly because I would always finish my work pretty quickly. And I talking class and. I just talk and, and pretty and make a decent distraction. So my mom would get called and like, oh my God, your son just talking. And I'm like, well, he finishes work. I he's talking, but he did it. He did his work. So that be the reason why I get in trouble is that I, I just, I've been work really fast and I just start talking and in middle school, I got in trouble a lot less for that kind of stuff cuz I was, it got a little more challenging, but I was still pretty. That's my work got done.

Anthony Moore:
But my sister, LA Sean has autism and we, she is a great, but like older than me, or was when we were going to school together. So I was in 6 grade, 2 in seventh grade. And from time to time, again, a lot of kids would pick on her, bully her. So I would, I'd be the person with my sister, right, to send out my sister and every now and then led to a fight or two. But the school staff understood that I was a good kid. I just sometimes things got. A little rough with remain the Sean. So I was mostly a good kid, but I ran to a few things when I was a middle school.

Anthony Moore:
11 school and in high school? Well, well, in middle school, I went from six grade to 7th grade. And I went to purging middle, which is like in. Oh, my God. What's that area? Oh, my God. I don't have my tongue. It's like Santa something, but it's a. It's like a little Lamesa, I think. No, it's near Cow's Mountain. Whatever Cow's Mountain is right there.

Anthony Moore:
Lake Murray. It's there. Isn't like very. So I went to Pershing Middle in Lake Murray. That's kind of where I found that I like music a lot. When I was in secure, I was inquire, but in 7th grade, I someone do something music wise, but I just didn't I didn't want to buy anymore.

Question:
 So do you still do music or no?

Anthony Moore:
So now I just kind of played bass guitar on my side I my primary school. But I do feel like that music is a great. Hobby. And I think that everyone should probably, like, try to flex that muscle when they can. So I played bass guitar on the side, but when I was in middle school, I picked up the cello and that's was kind of my main thing in middle school.

Anthony Moore:
I was a cello player and I was like the main cheers. I got all the solos and stuff. So that's, remember, mostly from middle school was me playing the cello a lot and.

Anthony Moore:
Leaving middle school and high school, I had a lot of family issues going on and my mom couldn't really be around to take me to high school like that. Eh, the ones that were in my immediate area were not the best. Schools and my family went to high schools and they didn't really, it didn't wasn't really a good turnout for them. So my mom just or enrolled me into an online charter called Altis. Tools. So it'd be like I'd have an office that I go into maybe three times a week for, like, two hours. But for the most part, my curriculum would be online. So it was really up to me to the hunker down and to study. Cuz no one was really watching me. I'd have, like, a little teacher who would like, hey, your progress, whatever. But it wasn't like. I wasn't getting up and going to school that much. I wasn't. Like, it was mostly me and my mom wasn't too crazy around to my progress. So it was really up to me to make sure that I got my work done. I hated that school a lot.

Anthony Moore:
It just. No, I know. Rush curriculars, no clubs, no activities, just solid work. I value the ethic you gave me, but I would have preferred to go to regular high school. But everything turned out pretty fine. I graduated and I left that school proudly. And now I'm here in college.

Question:
But can you tell me a little bit about your mom and yours relationship?

Anthony Moore:
Me and my mom. She is a single mother. So growing up and even like in my teenagers, I, I kind of grew some resentment or against her when I was maybe in high school, like a little after high school cuz I was just really upset, like, why don't I get to have whatever other people have and what not. My mom is always been like a kind of person who loves me to death. But the challenges of living in poverty and like having not the best mental health, being a single mother of 3 kids, I didn't really realize it is not really easy. I have like three kids in that situation. So now. Nowadays, me and her, we communicate back and forth. She lives up in. She lives in mirror. It now. And I love my mom, but I also, I hold her for her own, like things she got going on. So it's like a left from a distance, but also like, I love you and my mom, but also like, I need to take care of myself as well we're.

Question:
What about your sister? You said she is autism, right? So how was dealing with having a sibling with autism? Did you ever feel you had to step up and kind of be like a, like a leader to her or like a safety net or anything?

Anthony Moore:
So I have two older sisters. Jordan Lasean has autism. And my mom always also like, oh, you're the, you're the, you're youngest older brother. And I'm like, kind of, cuz I've always, I kind of had to like, and not had to as. Oh, I had to I, I semester. So it's it comes it's like a notion.

Anthony Moore:
It's like a no data to me, right? I have to look out for her and help her out. She communicates very differently than most people. Whenever she's like she's upset or sad, she's really quiet. Really back office. And I have to kind of like, I understand how to communicate her cuz I grew up her. There'll be times where the Sean will have a bit of an episode and I'll have to, like really get on her level, cuz very few people in her life kind of know how to sit down and talk with her. And they get frustrated and they respond, storm off and whatever.

Anthony Moore:
But I understand on how she communicates. She's older than me, so I try to hold her to that adult standard, but also understand like she has challenges and she's just trying her best and it, ever since I was a kid, I, I, I've, if. About the need to stand up for the Sean. But it isn't more of like, oh, I have to with more like, that's my sister, no da.

Question:
how would you give someone advice? Say someone has an autistic sister or an autistic sibling and they're kind of just struggling with it. What advice would you give to someone who's dealing with that?

Anthony Moore:
Well I just say that like being your divergent, like. In my opinion, everyone thinks a little differently. Everyone thinks and acts a little differently. Everyone has different ways of perceiving of the world, and no one way of thinking is right or wrong. And I see the same thing with Sean. And she is so smart, but she just takes a little more time or she looks at it differently. The most people, and I see that people who make fun of that type of process just aren't mature enough to understand that we all think differently as humans, such as how it is, you know, in the Sean. Just more of the most people, my best friends, autistic. And he thinks differently most people as well. But he's also super duper smart. And so it has nothing to do with intelligence. It's all to do with how we perceive things and we operating differently. I maybe I'll look at something very different than you do, that just kind of how people work. And I just see autism as just like that, just of different way of seeing things.

Anthony Moore:
Then I don't think that anyone should. We put down for thinking a certain way, cuz. That just. I thought people who are original. How they're made. People who are innovative, they think they see things in a different light. And words do hurt. Contrary to popular belief, words do hurt. But you have to understand that some people just aren't mature enough to grasp the idea that people think differently. And you shouldn't let them put you down because you just, you have a certain way of you being the world and that's okay.

Question:
How's the your major? How's that going? Like, how's school and homework and is it a lot? I feel like I'm dealing with that, too, right now or.

Anthony Moore:
Something like I could talk all day, but my major in the career that I wanna go in. To my major currently is interesting cuz I'm more concerned about what I want to transfer over to. So I wanna career in data science. I want to database inquiry. So right now. I'll end up leaving my call with the Associates in mathematics for transfers so I can transfer over to university and applied mathematics with the concentration.

Anthony Moore:
In computer science or data science, I could talk all day about how much I love the applications of math. I think it is a super duper broad topic that not a whole lot of people who just kind of take service level math, understand how Mahatha lives in everything we do. And data science is literally how anything gets done. Like literally your app, you need to acquire data to make certain Inc insights or make certain things. Everything.

Anthony Moore:
You know, so right now I'm taking calculus to Physics 195, which is mechanics, black cities class. And later on I'll be taking an education course for cuz. I'm a tutor. And I'll also be taking a dance course up in Linley College in Berkeley. So it's definitely high intensity co semester right now but I my vision is transferred to university of California Berkeley, the mathematics because they have a data science program. So there, I could probably minor in data science and get my concentration in that or computer science, whatever works. But they. Have both really good data science and computer science programs, so I need to really make sure I am prepared for rigorous semesters.

Anthony Moore:
Cuz it's all gonna get harder from here. So it's definitely challenging, but I enjoy a challenge personally. I'm just that kind of person. I like things that are challenging. I'm a little competitive in nature, as in like, if someone does something, I'm fully confident I can do that as well. If I put my mind to it. It's definitely challenging, but I think that I got it. And with enough planning, I can do it. And I can talk all day about, like, how much I love mapping cuz every time I hear. About different pressures were like physics or chemistry or compliance. Like there is so much things you can figure out using math, and it's absolutely nuts. There's sometimes, well, I go, oh, my God, you can do that. It's mad. Broad. So I'm still learning day by day, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me. But that's my aim on it. They have a career in data science and I wanna graduate from University California Berkeley with the degree Applied Mathematics in the concentration in either Data, Science, computer science.

Question:
If you had to write a college admissions essay on anything you wanted, what would you write it on?

Anthony Moore:
I think. I know it. I would write it, something and. Round persistence and just like the raw hunger. They just want to learn more, want to know more, want to just do better.

Anthony Moore:
There math is all about tenacity, about trying and trying again. And I feel like life is very similar, where things happen and you can't really control it, but you just have a, a desire just to see it through. Through and just to solve whatever is going on. So I think I would connect my love, the mathematics in problem solving to my own life.

Anthony Moore:
As in, like, not everything is going on. I really don't know what I'm looking at either, but I know that I, with enough, like, studying with enough resources gathered, I have the tools to, to solve it and make it happen. I, I, every time I tell, I talk to things about math, they get it wrong once and they get frustrated and they go, oh, I hate this. It's like, no, that's the part of learning. That's life as well. Failure, looking a little stupid, trying new things, right? It's a part of life. And I think I would write it about just persistence. Just keep on getting at it. Don't let failures get you down. Don't let mishaps get you down. Don't let, you know, anything is gonna get you down. That's what life's all about.

Anthony Moore:
I think that's also why I love Mad Cuz it's all about not everyone knows of solution right off the bat. I'll be working on a problem for an hour, but I'll get it. So I think I write it around that just tenacity and in persistence and also just like just leveraging on people, leveraging on your community. Nothing is meant to be done alone. We, we're, we live in a, as a African Americans, we believe in a communalistic type of living. As in like we believe that everything is best done together. And I talk about probably how I relied on other people and select to help me get where I need to be, but also in turn, I lend my own resources. So it's a give and take. Nothing is meant to be done alone. So I probably highlight that as one of my called essay. I thought about this a lot so I can talk about this forever too.

Question:
What's your favorite type of music? I know you said you like Tyler the creator last time.

Anthony Moore:
I can actually I can't quite pinpoint one genre cuz I listen to literally everything. I just, I see Tyler cuz. That was like my high school, dude. Like when I was doing online high school, I didn't really have much like to do or to kind of like people to talk to. I listened like a lot of music entirely was when ours. I actually related to a lot. But if I would say genre. I'd say if overall, probably like abstract hip hop. Like hip hop, but there's not too like normal or maybe with another genre thought into it, like I love jazzy. Pop, any sort of hip hop would like some sort of horn in it or like a jazzy undertone.

Anthony Moore:
Own. Oh, I love that. I love jazz as well. My grandfather is a really big jazz head. I listen to a lot growing up. There's a station at City College called San Diego Jazz 88.3, and I listen to it all through my life, still today. Eh. So anything with jazzy undertones I really love.

Anthony Moore:
I'm slowly getting into rock music. I've always been the rock music, but very surface level, like Metallica and stuff like that. I'm listening to a band. For tool right now. They're really nice. I love them.

Anthony Moore:
Allison changes when I'm listening to as well. I'm just trying to, I'm trying to get more into rock music, but I absolutely love it. Like I said, I play bass, so anytime I listen to a song, I'm like, oh, that's a nice baseline. Typically the rock song that I listen to, but any sort of fusion of genres, any sort of weird, odd like. This sounds like a weird like bridging. It's a machine is like a dude wrapping with metal music in the background. So cool. Any sort of mix like that, but. Abstract kind of music that's a little different than the typical, like, Billboard 100. So actually hip hop, maybe like jazzy undertones, maybe like metal, like wrapping in it. That's kind of what I like right now I can talk about it. About that as well. I'm a big music ad.

Question:
What's your favorite? Do you like to go outside? Do anything in nature, give any hobbies like that?

Anthony Moore:
Sure. I would in the. I mean, I just like taking walks. I think just, it just great for your brain, just. To slow down, just go for a stroll every now and then. Me and my buddies hike every now and then at Cow's Mound, but I think more of as far as active activities. Oh, no, I escape the. Right. I skate pretty often. When I couldn't drive, I would just skate around campus, skate to school. I would hop on the bus and skate. So that's what I did quite a lot beginning of this year. Now I'm driving right now, so I hop up the board for a second just to make everything a little faster.

Anthony Moore:
But to stay active in my meantime, I work out like 3 times a week. I would take pride in physical wellness. I used to be like 300 pounds, so I really cut down on my weight. I'm like 220 right now. And I really try to make sure that I still maintain that way. Wait, a mask? A huge tickler about it. But I just, it just feels nice after you have a good workout.

Anthony Moore:
Last night I ran like two miles, which is probably nothing to a runner, but that is insane for me. I do not run, so I. I make sure I stay active by going to the gym. And every now and then I'll skate or not.

Anthony Moore:
Oh, and I love going to the beach. I love going to the beach. Boogie Born is like soup. I can do that for. I can do that all day for real.

Anthony Moore:
No, I'm a pretty great swimmer. I'm really competitive with that, too.

Question: Did you take Spanish?

Anthony Moore:
I just finish in high school and I just did enough to pass it. Cuz in the high school really wasn't about that, like a plus mentality. So everything that I learn from that when and when they're out of the other, I, some, I could probably recognize some Spanish, but I probably can't tell you anything in it.

Question:
Okay. What do you look for in relationships?

Anthony Moore:
I think in relationships, I just look for someone they share my life with. And I feel like a lot of people don't look for that at the moment. From what I can see, a lot of people kind of are just looking for someone. To complete them. And I don't really agree with that. And I, I don't, I don't really think that you need, you should look for someone to complete you, rather just complete yourself and then look for someone who, who you would see as a compliment to your life or who you can in share your life with right now, I'm talking to a few people, but I'm not too serious because I'm still kind of working on myself. But also, like I said, trying to go to Berkeley, so. I think I'm just looking for someone to share my life with. But I don't think it should get to the point to where it's like, I'm not complete if I don't have a per I'm looking for someone compliments my life and has emotional intelligence. That's a huge thing. You have to be. You have to be emotionally smart. I need someone who is rather empathetic and get a understanding emotions and feelings, cuz. Is that's where Rachel are built off of, our emotions. And I need someone who is pretty mature in that nature. And I just someone to share my life with and someone who's emotionally intelligent and also has their own life.

Anthony Moore:
I need, I want to see what you got going on. I don't wanna just, I want, I don't want my life to be in relationship. I'm saying I wanted to be a highlight of my life. But I also I have this over here, so I need us both to have something going on and we rather like, I guess, accomplished in a sense.

Question:
 f you were to ever be a parent, which I don't know if that's what you wanna do, but how do you think? You're like, parenting skills be.

Anthony Moore:
I think that. I think I definitely wanna be a parent. I think it depends if. It depends on. I know that if I have a daughter, I. She'd probably, like, push me over and I. She'd get anything she wanted out of me. I know that there, if I had a daughter, she would like get anything she wanted out of me. I would love to have a daughter. I think I'm not a son. I'd see him. I'd also I it'll get okay. Anything like small defense? List like Charles me apart.

Anthony Moore:
But I think if I had a son, I probably want to just teach him in daughter to both of my guess this, I want to just teach them how to be a good human, as in just how to.

Anthony Moore:
Have good values. How to not be pessimistic? Being optimistic. I want them to be like, I feel like it's so cool nowadays to be like negative. And I want, really want my kids to see the good things and then really enjoy their selves in life and also just be free to be whoever, they wanna be. So I think I just, I'd be a pretty chill parent, but it also, like I hold them accountable for things that I just make sure they're on the right track. Do what you want, be he wanna be. Just be a good person and try the best you can.

Anthony Moore:
But I think I love it. I, I'd be, I think about all time, I'd be like the best at ever. I'd be like to miss it ever but I just let my kids do what they want, but be who they want to be.

Question:
Where would you wanna live?

Anthony Moore:
But just be a good person. Don't doing things stupid. Don't do drugs. Staying in school and just do something that you love that would keep you off the streets, but.

Anthony Moore:
I really enjoyed in Berkeley, like the weather, like it's like. Kind of like Foresty and a little more cool than San Diego. Almost like a overcast, I guess the states miss. Like that'd be nice. Not like Woodland states or that's a cities with like, I guess like an overcast. Ish type tone. I don't really think about that too much, honestly. I just know I.

Anthony Moore:
I'd probably like where I'd stay location wise, this is somewhere like my kids could grow up in. I'd want them to be around a certain black population cuz I. Why do I want them to be in tune with themselves but also have a lot of like, other diverse cultures and at ethnicities to be around? You have to live with every kind, all kinds of people. But I'd want them to also be in a location to where they can have black friends, they can go to a school with a good but population. So I never really think about that, though, but probably just a nice place with nice weather. Is somewhere they can live and be safe.

Question:
If you could start in a TV show, it would be.

Anthony Moore:
This kind of TV show would be it's a good one. I'm gonna like. Let me think. I don't wanna like dirt out or anything. Let me think about this. I can start a TV show would be. I think like I would love to be. In like a documentary. I think research is like a big thing in my career that I wanna do. So I would love to be like.

Anthony Moore:
And one of those probably like documentary related to, of course, math or like computer science, some like that. There's documentary. Netflix called them the Great Hack. And then slide. They're talking about the 2020 election in a Cambridge Analytica, the a data that like a data processing company and kind of how like the good fraudulent in the election. And I think that there's like the main dude, like, I think the way he's kind of. Like put in that, I guess, documentary is kind of cool. It's like a documentary, like following like the actual story, but it's like he's the one who's piecing it together and everything. So probably something like that. I think that'd be kind of cool, some sort of documentary, anything like anything.

Question:
 Do you like documentaries?

Anthony Moore:
It depends on what it is really. There's just certain topics and something that I'm just super interested. Then I guess anything but these science in my computer science, anything about like cognitive science like neuroscience I'm really into. I really enjoy those like.

Anthony Moore:
The old dude, like speaking about penguins or some stuff. I'm talking about like that Geo you don't talk about. He is like a certain voice. Like stuff like that. I think that'd be that. Those are cool documentaries that I like to turn on every now and then. Just watch.

Question:
What's your dream car?

Anthony Moore:
Dream car. Another thing I don't think about too much. I think as long as it gets me from point eight to point B, it's cool. I think definitely when I get older, I have a bit more money and I'll be able to spend something on something nice. But I really like, if I were. Oh, if I were, like, to buy a few cars just cuz I had money, why not? No, probably it's, I think it's a BMW M3, like. It's a. It's like a vintage car that. I think it's like a 1991 or something like that. It looks really cool. Really nice. It's like another one similar to it, like the Ford RS two hundred. It's like a vintage sports car, like any type of car that looks like that, like old but like I'm like a common Jerry Gold, but I guess like 1990 like sports car. They're kind of cool. So I probably like look into that type of category of car and see which one just kind of look cool.

 Question:
what's your favorite color? 

Anthony Moore:
I hate saying this cuz it's a such a like, it's not really color. I just, I like black is a nice color, especially when it comes to clothing. It just, it's a super simple color. It goes with most things. It's not, it's not like. It's just black. But I if other than that, I like gold a lot, like black and gold is pretty nice. Blue is a great color. It's simple for like that black blue gold. I like green a lot, only cuz, like, not the actual green color, but like. Like you're saying like a force like how like nice and lush it looks like the greenery, like green, brown, like those are nice colors. But I. Let's say two. Probably like black and gold. Black gold or maybe blue.

Question:
Do you like jewelry? 

Anthony Moore:
I were like, bracelets? These are tiger eyes. People who are super in the chocolate. Would like master me if I butcher this, but these are tiger I talk was there like, I forgot what area of it, but like some people believe in chalk words going from your forehead to your like growing like knees area. And tiger eyes kind of like are for confidence and inner power. And I just the people say that you were on your left arm just to kind of activate the chakra. You wear whatever your. Lacking, and I don't really believe in it, but I think it's kind of cool. The cool meeting. So I wear that. I just, I have this band on that this. It literally means nothing, but it's. I got this from. As you know, it doesn't. I got this from when I was in my study abroad from Africa, and it's really faded. It's all it, but it says tagali memorial remembrance. And it's cuz the Rwandan genocide and there is a memorial for the genocide in Kigali, which is to capital Rwanda. And just a little gift shop that I got a few nicknaps from. I just, I got this ban. I just never stop wearing it ever since.

Question:
Do you get any other things when you're there?

Anthony Moore:
I have this, like, I have this little pendant on my backpack. It's like this little gold pendant. It says Umbo and Ubuntu was a proverb, like an African proverb that means like humanity, like togetherness. And it's roughly translate to like I am because of who we're. And it just, it's this, like I mentioned earlier, people who are from part of Africa aspirate. But they believe in communitalism. So Bundu is the problem. That means we're better together and we're connected as humans, like every one of us, like as.
Anthony Moore:
Thing humans means we were all interlinked somehow so I guess the good answer to keep on to, I have like a couple, like just a key chains of my backpack. This is like a. This one's a. This one says error. I think it says E. It just means welcome to our. Home. I got that from Rwanda. And this is? This is from the. Forgot what the mountains were, right? Rwanda is famous for this one mountain. But you can go there and just see gorillas, like just no truck, nothing. Like just gorillas walking in front of you.

Anthony Moore:
It. It's pretty, it's pretty dangerous. He like, it's pretty scary, really, would just walk up to you like thousand pound creature, like rip you and. But I forgot all. But there's a certain. Number one, he was.

Adrina:
Those animals come to your car and you, like, feed them.

Anthony Moore:
There was a national Parker when we went to. Oh, my God, it's slipping. My it's slipping. I'm looking for the name of it. The national park. It's called the. I'm a blubber right now. It's super big. It takes like 12 hours to go through up and down. And it's a safari park and it's like drafts, like elephants. Allegedly some lines in there, but we were there for like six hours and there was no line. But like Gazelle and stuff like that, the park was called. But it's like this big national park and you can go there and see. Found it. You can go there and see the.

Anthony Moore:
The animals, aka Gara, the aka Gear National Park in Rwanda I it's in Rwanda, but it's so big that it borders Tanzania. Like it's huge. But I've been to one of those before.

Adrina:
I wanna go to that. That sounds cool.

Anthony Moore:
It's pretty awesome. But it's, you gotta be patient. Like I said, like six hours we saw like, you saw a lot of animals. But don't go bed not seeing a lion, cuz they're, it's like three of them in there.

Question:
Are you a dog or cat person?

Anthony Moore:
Definitely dog person. I love my big dogs. I love like. Okay. I'm a dog person, but any dog that's classified as a small dog, I just don't like. They talk too much. They complain a lot. I have.

Anthony Moore:
I've had three dogs my whole life. Well, I have four. We have one called Ponio. She's a little Maltese poodle, but she's really my sister's dog. But I've had three dogs my whole life, Kita, Kuma and grizzly, and they're all named after bears grizzly is my dog right now. And he just, he's a big American. Edfordshire rottweiler mix. And I just love big dogs. There's just kind of, they're kind of just chill creatures. They're really nice and caring. They don't make too much noise. They don't complain a whole lot. They're just really lovable and cuddly creatures. And despite how big they are, they're super sweet.

Anthony Moore:
I love big dogs. I think like babies and dogs. Like a dog can get anything out of me, like if he knew how to. I love dogs so much of a big one, of course. Small ones. Some of them are cool. This a lot of make no.

Question:
If you were a dog, what kind of dog would you be?

Anthony Moore:
Probably be like a Saint Bernard or like. Like a Cane Corso or Saint Bernard. I think zebra just kind of really cuddly. I. I think they just, they're super big dudes, but they don't really, they don't really, they don't like they'd heard much. King Corsos would hurt somebody, I think. But they just kind of seem like they're chill. To that, kind of like how they just only look like cool dogs. I don't think I would be a cool dog if I was a dog.

Question:
1. Have you turned 21 yet? Okay.

Anthony Moore:
 I'm nineteen.

Question:
 But what is your ideal 21st birthday look like?

Anthony Moore:
I'm keep really to. You? I'm not too huge on birthdays. Like if I get a cake. Imagine. To get like a high five, I'm cool.

Anthony Moore:
I'm cool. When you gonna have cool I don't, I'm not too huge and extravagant like, oh my God, birthday. I'm, I don't know. I'm not too big on it. So if I just get a cake happy birthday, I'm gonna get my new, I'm gonna get my new ID and I probably might not even use it cuz I don't really, I'm not too big on drinking. Like, I don't. No, I think that it's taste like rubbing alcohol. And I don't know why I take. I drink that. Willingly, but.

Question:
did you wanna go travel somewhere with your friends or go somewhere, let's say?

Anthony Moore:
Oh, not for my birthday. Looking the data. I'm well. But for my birthday, just get a small little cake, sis. Show my sisters for a day and get back to it none of them.

Question:
What's your favorite social media?

Anthony Moore:
I mean, like, I try. To say I hope social media. Why I find I. I if I were to say them, they use the most how we Instagram or YouTube I think that I'm slowly realizing how kind of time consuming those apps are and kind of how like bad. That it can be for you mentally to kind of always see everyone's like, you always just see everyone's best life. Like this is the best things in their life. It's not how life is. Life has UPS and downs, ebbs and flows. In Instagram, we really highlights the best part people's lives. And people compare themselves other people all the time. So. I just, I use it every now and then. Just, they connect with my friends. But I try to say off of it, YouTube is just cuz my favorite creators are on there. So every now and then I'll just watch some YouTube. But I try to see after social media apps a lot.

Question:
Are you more of like a comedy movie kind to person or like a emotional movie? If you had choose.

Anthony Moore:
That's a good one, definitely comedy. I like a good laugh. I like a good laugh. But also, I also enjoy like. Emotion because they're a bit more like existential. They make you think a little more about what's going on, but also just like a good laugh.

Anthony Moore:
Like if I'm turning on a movie, I probably just want a good laugh. I was there. Always a good joy. I like rookie Bobby a lot. That's a really funny movie. The all the Fridays are super funny. They can quote all the Fridays probably. I watch them so many times growing up. I was gonna find a little movie once on the tip of my tongue. I'm not quite grasping it. On. My gosh, it's not a movie, but it's the Eric Andre show is super. I love that show so much. It is. It's such a stupid way of. It's just stupid comedy, but it's kind of my kind of comedy, so I like a good laugh. Like, I like a good chuckle. It's good for the soul.

Question:
 Are you more of a handwritten type note or online type note?

Anthony Moore:
That's really funny how you just ask that. Cuz I just, I was just given an iPad by my buddy. Cuz I went through like 20 notebooks so far. Like I'm killing a lot of trees. So I was like, let me make sh. Let me try to find an alternative to take notes. So my buddy gave me her iPad. She had a new one, and I got good notes on it. And I'm actually really enjoying it. I think I probably prefer, like, the iPad notes with the pen. Something about it, like, makes it stick more with me. I don't know. It's just something about the way, like writing on the screen and you can kind of open all the photos really quickly. You don't have to go flipping page by page. You can just have make a new file. I don't know something about digital notes, but also being able to still write down on it is probably like this might be my new way of taking notes for now on. Through the iPad. The plan.

Question:
What's the hardest class you've taken so far?

Anthony Moore:
Of horizontal I've completed so far probably has been my Java programming class in spring. That was a challenging a to obtain. I was, I was, I get, I strive for master whenever I do. So I tried it my best to get my. Is I haven't failed yet, but that a was super challenging cuz I was literally looking at my grade, like, can I just not do this last project and still get my a? Much project was so hard that I was like, my grade is so good, I'm just gonna opt to not do it. And I finish with like a 91%. I was like, oh, my God, that was a really challenging class. As programming for the first time in a language like Java is super trick.

Anthony Moore:
Especially when there's deadlines for the assignments but honestly, like, look, the way things looking right now with this physics class, this might be the article I've taken in a while. This is really like, this is a lot. This business class supplied math and a lot of, just like you have to know, a lot of facts and a lot of like. Just like concrete things, like no one would just know the acceleration, the gravity top of their head. No one knows that it's negatively meter squared. No one knows that. You have to know that as a physicist. So this is definitely probably the hardest I've taken so far, but as is the one I completed definitely my job of class back in the spring.

Question:
Are you a coffee person?

Anthony Moore:
I say so. I'm not taking it every day, but when the semester gets started and it's like, I'm a little groggy, I named me at. Nice cup of coffee. I wouldn't say I'm a coffee person. I just see as a tool every now and then to kind of get me going. And the way I wake up, though, in the morning is I just take cold showers. It activates your I think it's called your parasympathetic nervous. System where it's like you're kind of fight or flight, like your alert nervous system. So when you hop in a cold shower, like cold water, you kind of, you do a really large exhale. So it's kind of hard wake up in the morning. Like it really, it shocks me awake and I feel good the entire day. But every now and then I'll use coffee to. I use coffee to wake me up a little more.

Anthony Moore:
It's definitely something you had to ease into online. Like the first like week or two, me doing a way, I can't do this. But you'll get used to the climate. It's it's it.

Question:
So you take like freezing cold? It's like freezing cold.

Anthony Moore:
Oh my rule of thumb is if this, if the mirrors are like steamed when I get out the shower, I, it was too hot. So I. It needs to be like freezing cold.

Anthony Moore:
Just a. It's a challenge you gotta get in.

Anthony Moore:
You gotta just don't think about it. You guys walk in there, it's like going to the really early, like the water is freezing cold.

Anthony Moore:
Just gotta go in there. Just don't even think about it. Just walk in there, you're regular.

Adrina:
When you take a warm shower and then you get into click clean sheets, that's like my favorite feeling.

Anthony Moore:
But you feel tired afterwards. I don't know. Me present, I feel tired after a hot shower. I'm ready to lay down I just don't take hot touch number, cuz.

Adrina:
I feel like maybe cold shower in the morning and then hot shower at night. Is that live?

Anthony Moore:
If I take a hot shower, I'm used to it again. Oh, you see, the hotness thing.

Adrina:
That's crazy. I could not.

Question:
Are you a gift giver?

Anthony Moore:
And I mean it. Like if I didn't, if I think you deserve a gift or you need one, like if it's your birthday and no one's doing anything, I'm gonna go out there and get you a gift. That's kind of like how I am. But I think that's not really like my love language or anything. It's like this a way I like, like my sister, she had a birthday last week and she's like, oh, I don't want do anything. Like now I'm gonna go buy you a cake. I'm gonna buy you a video game. I'm gonna buy like though, that's just, that's a gift giving.

Anthony Moore:
Like you need a gift for that, like, come on. Right. But I think I'm more of like a affirmations person. Like, you can do it. Hey, you're having a bad day. Come speak to me. I think I'm more of a, of a, I guess, an emotional investing person than a gift giver.

Question:
What would you consider your style as, like your clothing style?

Anthony Moore:
I just, okay, so again, I think she don't really have a, let me think about this. There were a lot of things so I always wear vans or flat footed shoes. I don't like air maxes. I think they just. They. Just they make me look weird. Look, I can't quite describe it. Like, I look pretty typical, like more normal in a flat footed shoe, like a van. I always wear jeans or slacks or cargo pants. And maybe I'll wear like a black shirt or a s like a jacket or a button up, a like a button up on my Ards Wear T-shirt. Maybe I'll wear a hoodie, like anything, like vans, like pants and like top, so. Kind of like skater ish. I try to appear like that. I actually do skate, but I'm not like a crazy, like, trickster skater. I just like the cruise around, but. I do. I appreciate the kind of this, the practical style they use. But escape. I just, like, wear vans and pants. I don't really wear shorts like that unless I'm going to the gym. I don't really think about my clothes too much. For me, like, a clothes, they work, but also like looking nice but not presentable, but like. Not like thinking about my style too much.
