事件    自我介绍录音整理

I'm 18 years old and I bought a scarce
French high.
I swam
at Disney for almost 14 years,
and I'm almost done
with my last high school season,
which is exciting, but also kind of sad.
I love to do, or I've been doing art
ever since I was a little child.
I was always someone coloring box
and coloring like pencils and all of that.
And I loved it
and everything that would come with me.
I think those are
two of my biggest hobbies.
I love mentoring my middle schoolers,
martial men, all those
as probably the most amazing thing
that I think I've done.
I wish I was a molly Nine
Nations delegate.
Marshall Ever since I was in seventh grade
and had a lot of
really influential mentors.
I was actually given an opportunity
to become one of them, and I mentors six
or eighth graders on world topics
and how to speak and how to
first time yourself and how to write,
which I've been doing for four years now.
And that's really, really exciting to me.
But then it also gave me the opportunity
to run one of the largest conferences
for the largest conference
west of the Mississippi River
at the San Diego
Regional Mall, United Nations Conference.
I think this year
it's close to 500 people.
I think it's 300 delegates and 200,
100 something visitors,
which is a really, really big deal.
And I was given the opportunity to
actually run that with five other people.
Push has been a really cool opportunity
and a really exciting opportunity
because I get to work
with like UCSD with that
and a lot of other really
big organizations, which is a lot of fun.
My grandma that sounds really sappy
and really all sweet, but
she is a cancer survivor, a
breast cancer survivor,
which really showed me,
and she actually never complained about
I was very young when she was diagnosed,
and I never really knew that she was a
breast cancer survivor until I got older.
And I realized because she was always
the strongest woman that I had known,
she used to crochet for those
who were needy and that was like,
if you have a skill and if you have
talent, you're going to use it for good.
And she was always she's always been
about community service and giving back
to the people that you grew up with
and never losing your roots.
So I think she really was probably my she
is my most influential person in my life.
I think my parents both
have very recognizable names
and growing up, they actually immigrated
to the United States.
I think it's early 2000 and with 911
happening, 2002, they're in that zone.
Louis, Missouri,
which is a very Republican area.
Especially in that time,
I think my dad and both
my parents were very, very concerned.
The Islamophobic
movement happening on its states, which
unfortunately caused them to be scared,
and me
not understanding what it means
to embrace my heritage and my culture
and everything that comes with being brown
in the United States.
And it's taken me a really long time
to understand that it is
something to celebrate
and it is something to be excited for.
So I work at an internship at the moment
really close to my school,
and we are running a hot Ramadan
project and I'm exposing them
to the Arabic language
and what Ramadan is so that there are
other girls or boys who are brown
and they can they don't have to have
the same struggles.
I did.
I'm a planner, but I'm also very stubborn.
And a lot of people think of stubborn
as being a negative thing,
and that's not a good thing.
But for me,
I actually use my stubbornness
and I really, really fight for something.
If I know that I'll
if I really, really believe in something
and I'm really headstrong about it,
I will do everything
and it takes to get there.
I just have to really believe in nothing.
And my stubbornness is like
my biggest strength in that situation.
I'm also a very big planner.
I like things to be detailed
and I like to know
how things are going to happen
and the steps and all of that.
So I tend to be very organized as well.
I think you can't have pity for yourself.
I think everyone has situations
in their life and I think
everyone has a lack of it.
You know, everyone gets strong cards.
And unfortunately I had to move a lot
as a kid.
Just the circumstance was that way.
My family was a little bit out of her for
a little while because of my dad's jobs.
And that caused it didn't cause me to have
like a very good childhood friends
or anything like that.
But my grandma always said, you have,
you know, you have to stick with it.
You have to find something you enjoy
and you have to help people.
So that really was ingrained in me
and I really took whatever skills I had
and I try to work for it and I just
I dream learned
not to have petty friends off and
to keep going to matter how hard it was.
If you want it, do it.
Don't be scared,
because I think fear stops us the most.
And I think fear doesn't
just happen with internally.
I think it's fear of society.
I think it's fair
that our parents may have
or people around us
that may have let me be installed in you,
but if there's something that you really,
really, really want,
do it and work for it.
Maybe not now, but really work for it.
Get there because you can
if you really want to.
Mali, United Nations.
I think that sounds really,
really like the right answer.
But for me,
the United Nations was really a way for me
to learn about my culture
and learn about who I was as a person.
I was always a shy kid growing up,
which is really hard to believe now.
But I am now a very outspoken person,
and that never used to be the case for me,
but I found an outlet
where I could speak up
and I grew into my skin
and then grew into who I was.
I learned to embrace it and what nations
really provide me an outlet
with likeminded people
to be able to speak my mind
and be able to learn about myself.
And that really did shaped me as a person.
A lot of what I do is based on my roots
and trying to explore that more and more.
I became very adaptable.
I don't like to sit like,
Oh, while people are thinking of,
Oh, I won't know anybody,
so I don't want to do it.
There was only times that I didn't know
anybody, but I still did it.
I showed up to school
when I had absolutely no idea.
When I came to Marshall Middle School,
I was a sixth grader.
Everybody knew everybody right?
Everyone had their cliques.
Everyone had their friends.
I know why I walked in.
And why the heck are you?
I don't even know where my classrooms
were.
And I figured it all out. So I have that.
I believe in myself enough to know that
I feel if I know nobody,
I can still get there.
That became my I think that became one of
my biggest takeaways from moving so much.
I hope that whatever I do, I'm
still able to help people.
And that sounds so cliche
and I don't mean it to,
but I think we all have the power
to help within us.
But you have to
you almost have to like, create that power
and you have to use
what you have to create it
and to help people
and that's one of our biggest purposes in
life, is to make sure that we create
change, will create a better society,
and that we leave behind
some kind of goodness for people.
And I have goals to somehow
get into the medical profession,
whether that's true public policy
or whether that is as a doctor,
I just really hope that I can create more
of a lasting change.
And that's one of my biggest goals.
