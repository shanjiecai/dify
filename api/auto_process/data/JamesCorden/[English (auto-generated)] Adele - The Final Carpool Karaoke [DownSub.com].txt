three

right so it's really really early in the

morning and it's the last week of The

Late Late Show so I'm going to wake

James up I'm driving

Julia will kill me

[Music]

all right come on

last week of shows I'm going to drive

you to work let's do the final carpool

oh my God

[Applause]

I'm actually not really in the makeup

actually not a brilliant driver so I

know you're not a brilliant person I'm

well aware of this I also can't sing

without clothes in my eyes so oh well

this is going to be great I can't

believe you're doing this Do You Know

the Way I Do by the way all right

I can't believe we just pulled out of

your drive and it crashed

the last couple

I'm excited and scared in equal measure

I don't know it's been a crazy eight

years yeah in one sense it feels like

it's gone like that and then another

sense I feel like I don't really

remember what life

I don't know I've never lived in La

without you guys so I'm like a bit

nervous about it to be honest with you

and obviously very very sad

very close to that car I don't know how

much

it's how I normally Drive I know you

just just let just give yourself a bit

of a ego you've also got Precious Cargo

I'm driving and also I know that if I

crash you'll keep it

[Laughter]

[Applause]

bringing me at the dark

[Music]

me thinking that we almost had it all

the songs

[Music]

[Applause]

you'll have my heart inside

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

we could have had you Heroes

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh come on

that was great

having worked with so many I'm

incredibly discomfortable I got it I got

it I got it I got it let me let me just

you hold the wheel okay you hold the

wheel and you just there we go

when you decided to take the job what

were you most afraid of at first the

thing I was most worried about was how

do we

get guests on the show do you know I

mean we couldn't book anyone and then

things like carpool I mean no one would

do it every one on planet Earth said no

but then suddenly Mariah Carey said yes

so we're like buzzing and she goes we'll

do it on Saturday

I'll scrub around we get there we do it

we turn up we're obviously waiting

around a little bit Mariah comes out and

Mariah comes out and the first thing she

says to me she goes

I'll I'll do the chat I ain't singing

okay and I looked at Gabe and I went

what am I going to do and he went dude

[Music]

I don't know how to change the

radio station we can

[Laughter]

you want to just

are you ready come on today I was up all

night

[Music]

what was the couple that surprised you

most because there's been some bloody

brilliant ones and a few ones obviously

but one of the ways that genuinely

surprised you there's been ones

throughout which you've checked like

Stevie Wonder changed it a lot because I

think when he did it yeah other artists

were like icons well if Stevie Wonder's

done it I'll do it you know and I think

him calling Jules to ah say I just

called to say I love you it's like a

real moment yeah are you ready Julia

[Music]

our one

because it broke all of those records

yeah

I think seeing how many people watch

that made artist like Bruno and Gaga and

people like that go oh hang on a minute

yeah yeah absolutely I'll do this

[Music]

when did we do the last carpool what

year was it it was December 2015. and

then we almost got you on the show

almost oh you want to talk about that it

looked I think it's quite funny

let's explain this so you as long as

we've been friends I've always said you

could never prank me no one could ever

prank me I'm I'm unprankable yes he's

like I can't be pranked and then I

remember you saying to me I'd love

someone to try and I it was after you to

David

after we did the David Beckham one that

was so good and I set up this whole

thing and when you say it out loud now

it's so ridiculous that there was a wild

bear on the loose and we'd flown

this animatronic bear from Canada

the worst thing was you got there early

I'm always early

yeah the real news channel we had the

real news we've got Gail King to record

the news breaking news

morning a 600 pound bear escaped from

L.A County Zoo and the eyes as you were

being interviewed and then Park Rangers

was flying and you'd be like oh my God

and obviously we haven't told any of

your team because we don't want them to

feel compromised and hide anything and

things like that yeah and your assistant

spots this tiny camera that's hidden on

a shelf and we're all going oh my God no

and he runs out of course to me and

tells you and you were like I'm being

inspired I'm being spied on and I said

who owns this house

and then we go downstairs I'm not happy

about this but we go downstairs and then

there's like another room that I need to

wait in and I go in as every piece of

merchanted of me I think we have a fan

oh my God

and then we were like the game's up

she's uncomfortable she's uncomfortable

[Applause]

she's unprankable she cannot be pranks

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

please

[Music]

[Applause]

come on

[Applause]

let's do another song

well hang on before we do this one but

this song is

very special to both of us well I just

saw that it's on there yeah I am and I

don't know how much you wanted we'd have

to talk a lot about it but the first

verse of this song which I think is some

of my best writing that I've ever done

even if I do say so myself

um was inspired by a conversation that

you and I had had

and it was like the 4th of January or

something of 2020. we just and we've

been on vacation together with the kids

and we're on our way home and my mood

had changed and

um and it was like the first year that I

felt like I had to hold myself

accountable

um for just being an adult whereas the

year before that where I like you know I

left Simon and stuff like that that you

and Jules and the kids were so integral

in looking after me and Angela making

sure that I didn't I remember you used

to do it with humor as well you used to

be like good luck with that one like you

know in any like sort of

thing I was pursuing and stuff like that

and then you were always so you were

like always an adult to me like you and

Julia are very much and you'd always

give me this advice so then I remember I

said to you on the way home I said

what's wrong I was like you just sitting

down and you let it all out to me and

you just you didn't feel stronger and we

were having what a six hour conversation

about it was like the whole way home it

was work staff and the internet and it

was all those things but then it got me

thinking I felt so unsafe

with you feeling unsafe because you've

always been that you have for like since

I was like 21 you've always been like

that like you know and then I went to

the studio a couple of weeks later

and I wrote this and I remember I sang

it into my phone and I sent it to you

and I do remember you saying that's

exactly how I was feeling it was

everything that I was feeling that day

I was flawed by

how

you'd managed to take everything that I

was feeling about myself and

life and just put it in a verse and it

was

I don't know I I it's the greatest

privilege that from something

from a conversation so

just honest between two friends yeah

that you would create such a thing that

blows my mind well if you listen to the

song I wrote about you then

oh

oh

it will make me cry no I know every time

I sing this song in Vegas I think of you

I love these lyrics as well amazing how

come on becomes so bounded by choice is

that somebody else makes

how come we both become a version of a

person we don't even like

we're in love with the world but the

world she just wants to bring us down

ideas

when there was a child every single

thing could blow my mind

[Music]

soaking it all out for fun but now I

only soak a wine

[Music]

listen I know how low I can go ahead

[Music]

hey

open time

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

trying to be somebody

else

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

I better believe me

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

that song man

it's just

so good

let me ask you about this when we did

the last couple yeah you were a Oscar

winner yep you were obviously a Grammy

winner yeah he subsequently won an Emmy

for your TV special yeah which means you

are one Tony Award away yes from

you now have the ego yeah

yeah what we're going to do here what's

what we thinking I really don't think

that that is ever gonna happen

um

I would never write a music or anything

like that because you hate musicals

people know how much you hate me

no I don't think I've ever said that

much I hate like respect The Artful

absolutely I just don't need to hear

everything in a song all the time like

you know I also think the ego suits me

better

don't tell me not to live

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

for all I want is

here

[Applause]

I believe

[Music]

yes

[Applause]

I've been doing that eight times oh my

God who

we left it all out there you see how

much I love you

I keep feeling like I'm completely

great and then I keep thinking oh this

is the last

this is the last this is the last coffee

okay what are we gonna do it's a lot

what will you miss most about the show

I'll miss I miss everything I think I

underestimated how many friends I've

made doing it and it's like a family

so more than anything I will just miss

going into work with my friends every

day

and I'm Really Gonna Miss Los Angeles

yeah I love it here it's been a

brilliant Adventure

but it's

it's I'm just so certain that it's time

for us as a family

with people getting older and

people that we miss

it's just it's time to uh

it's time to go home

this is when we first met this song

that's right foreign

[Laughter]

[Music]

just wondering

[Music]

there's CBS I told you I was taking it I

know and this is my last ever

time that I'll do this and then

it's blowing my mind that you've done

this for me you're one of my best

friends in the whole world and you are

mine I'm gonna miss you I love you and

you we have had the best times here and

oh my God we really have our

our

friendship and our family's friendship

is absolutely not

it has nothing to do with distance I

know and time I'm just not ready to come

back yet otherwise I won't come back

with you

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]
