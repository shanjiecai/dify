THIS
0:06
COULD BE HOW MANY PEOPLE

DEMOCRATS HAVE
0:36
A LOT OF IDEAS AND A LOT OF 
ENERGY AND A LOT OF

IF YOU WERE IN OFFICE, WHAT 
WOULD CONSTITUTE A 
NATIONAL
1:06
EMERGENCY?
1:06
>> OH, LET'S DO A LIST.
1:08
CLIMATE CHANGE, GUN 
VIOLENCE, STUDENT LOAN 
DEBT RIGHT OFF THE
1:15
TOP.
1:16
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) 
THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO 
BE
1:17
WORKING ON.
1:18
AND WE OUGHT TO BE 
WORKING ON IT TOGETHER.
1:21
CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT, 
AS A COUNTRY, THOSE ARE 
THE THINGS WE
1:23
SHOULD BE WORKING ON.
1:24
>> James: TELL ME, IN 
WASHINGTON, WHEN YOU'RE 
IN
1:27
WASHINGTON, BECAUSE IT 
FEELS LIKE YOU CAN'T MOVE 
FOR PEOPLE
1:31
COMING OUT AND SAYING 
THINGS LIKE THIS, AND FOR 
MANY OF US IT
1:34
FEELS LIKE NOTHING EVER 
CHANGES, IT FEELS LIKE 
PEOPLE IN
1:37
WASHINGTON ARE 
CONSTANTLY GOING, OH, THIS 
GUY, WHAT CAN YOU DO.
1:42
YOU'RE, LIKE, SOMETHING, 
MAYBE.
1:43
DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE 
WITHIN THE WALLS OF 
WASHINGTON, THE
1:46
ROOMS WE NEVER GET TO GO 
INTO, EVEN THE 
REPUBLICANS, DO YOU
1:50
EVER GET A REPUBLICAN 
GOING, JEEZ, THIS GUY, 
BEHIND CLOSED
1:54
DOORS, HUH?
1:55
>> ACTUALLY, THEY MOSTLY 
KEEP THEIR MOUTHS CLOSED 
NOW AND KIND
2:00
OF HIDE FA THEIR FACES.
2:04
BUT THE KEY IS WASHINGTON 
WORKS.
2:06
IT WORKS FABULOUSLY AND 
GREAT IF YOU'RE RICH.
2:09
WASHINGTON IS A PLACE 
THAT WORKS GREAT FOR 
GIANT DRUG COMPANIES,
2:12
JUST NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO 
ARE TRYING TO GET A 
PRESCRIPTION
2:16
FILLED.
2:17
IT WORKS GREAT FOR OIL 
COMPANIES THAT WANT TO 
DRILL EVERYWHERE,
2:20
NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE 
WORRIED ABOUT CLIMATE 
CHANGE.
2:23
IT WORKS GREAT FOR 
INVESTORS IN PRIVATE 
PRISONS, JUST NOT FOR
2:26
PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES ARE 
DESTROYED AND WHOSE 
COMMUNITIES ARE TORN
2:31
APART.
2:32
WE HAVE A CHANCE IN 2020 
TO SAY ENOUGH OF 
GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR
2:35
THE RICH AND POWERFUL, WE 
WANT TO MAKE 
GOVERNMENT WORK FOR THE
2:38
PEOPLE.
2:39
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> 
James: I MEAN, IT'S
2:46
INCREDIBLE HEARING YOU 
SAY IT.
2:47
IT'S MORE INCREDIBLE AND IT 
WILL BE MORE INCREDIBLE 
WHEN YOU
2:51
ANNOUNCE 50 CENT AS YOUR 
RUNNING MATE.
2:54
THAT'S WHEN ALL THIS IS 
GOING TO COME --
