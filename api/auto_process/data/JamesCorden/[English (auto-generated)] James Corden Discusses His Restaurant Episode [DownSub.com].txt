how's everybody doing did everyone have

a good week off we had a week after a

good one here have a good week huh yeah

what'd you do I uh I went to Disneyland

I barbecued I slept it was the it was

three for three baby three for three

yeah you know what I did a total I did a

total switch off oh yeah yeah no phone

no TV just really really cut myself off

if I missed have I missed anything did I

miss any news

I wish that was the case

um as some of you may have seen uh last

week there were there was there were

stories about me being banned from a

restaurant and at the time I considered

you know like tweeting about it or

instagramming about it like whenever

these sorts of moments come my way I I

like to adopt you know quite a quite a

British attitude of sort of you know

keep calm and carry on things are going

to get written about me never complain

never explain it's very much my motto

but as my dad pointed out to me on

Saturday he said Son well you did

complain so you might need to explain

um

look when you make a mistake you've got

to take responsibility so I thought I

would if it's okay I would share with

you what happened so a couple of weeks

ago I was in New York with some friends

and we went for breakfast at one of my

absolute favorite restaurants it's a

place called Balthazar and I genuinely I

love it there I love the food the vibe

the service if I lived in New York I'd

go every day

on the Proviso that you know they would

let me in so

we sit down we ordered and my wife

explained uh that that she has a serious

food allergy right so when everybody's

meals came my wife was given the food

that she was allergic to but no she

hadn't taken a bite of it or anything no

worries we sent it back all was good as

her meal came wrong to the table the

third time

In the Heat of the Moment I made I made

a sarcastic rude comment right about

cooking it myself and it is a comment I

deeply regret like I understand the

difficulties of being a server I work

shifts at restaurants for years I have I

have such respect and I value anyone

that does such a job and the team of

that restaurant

are so great that's why I love it there

the restaurant manager and the server

they were lovely they were lovely they

brought out four glasses of champagne as

an apology but we were like that's not

necessary we don't need it we'd had a

great time even for me it was too early

to start drinking so

but here's the truth of it right because

I didn't

because I didn't Shout

or scream like I didn't get up out of my

seat I didn't call anyone names or use

derogatory language

I've been walking around thinking that I

hadn't done anything wrong right but the

truth is like I have I made a rude rude

comment and it was wrong it was it was

an unnecessary comment it was ungracious

to the server

so last Monday the owner of the

restaurant had heard what happened and

he instagramed that I was banned from

his restaurant for two offenses one was

a meal that I I think was back in 2014

when I sent a dish back that had hair in

it and the other was last week right so

when I read this post I I I immediately

I got hold of his phone number I called

him straight away and I told him how

upset I was I was upset how upset I was

that anybody was was hurt by anything

that I had done and anything that I had

said and we had a good talk he

appreciated the call

I was happy that we got to clear the air

and I felt like if we dealt with it

privately you know but by this point the

story was out there and

what people were upset

when I become president of hell I'm

going to make super hell and put James

Corden in it

James cordon's so hard God I hate

carpool karaoke so much I don't even

sing to myself anymore

and my personal favorite which was wait

James Corden has a wife

thank you

right now look I I get it I totally

understand I understand everybody

getting upset and I and I accept I

accept everybody's opinion I also hate

as I said to the owner that day that

I've ever upset anybody ever it was

never my intention

it just wasn't and I love that

restaurant I love the staff there I hope

I'm allowed in again one day so I'm when

I'm back in New York I can go there and

apologize in person which is something I

will absolutely do we'll be right back

with more of the Late Late Show
